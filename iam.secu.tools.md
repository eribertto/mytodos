We are nearing the end of the section,

but first let's talk about the kind of security tools

we have in IAM.

So we can create an IAM Credentials Report

and this is at your account-level.

This report will contain all your accounts users

and the status of their various credentials.

We'll be actually generating it right now

and having a look at it.

The second security tool we're gonna use in IAM

is called IAM Access Advisor.

This one is at the user-level

and the Access Advisor is going to show

the service permissions granted to a user

and when those services were last accessed.

This will be very helpful because we are talking already

about the principle of least privilege,

and so using this tool, we're able to see which permissions

are not used and reduce the permission a user can get

to be inline with the principle of least privilege.

So I will see you in the next lecture

to show you how to use the security tools.
