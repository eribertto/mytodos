This will overwrite the OS Manjaro Linux in partition 
/dev/nvme0n1 size 238.17 GB
Create swap (no hibernate) 8.80 GB
login name eribertto
passwd MKO00987ytr
use same password for the admin account


Note: Manjaro hanged while checking the partition details! Had to do a hard reboot to get it up again

Begin time: 1950
End time: 1958

Success installing the archlinux XFCE and do some tweakings. Also success building carli iso from eriks YT tutorial and booting to the build live usb. Note however that no network manager in the applet nor no gui web browser.

below is the reply of Erik arcolinux dev:
	Erik Dubois
	add any package from the Arch Linux repos to the list packages.x86_64
	neofetch is explained - carli project



After testing out the live iso i can reboot just fine to the 2 OS mxlinux and arcolinux XFCE.
