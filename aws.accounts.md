Take note AWS erimendz account is suspended due to non payment:
Hello from AWS,

We are writing to notify you that your AWS Account is in danger of being suspended for non-payment. We have previously notified you about an unsuccessful payment of your past due AWS charges. An outstanding payment still remains on your account.

Your card payment ending in 1714 failed when we attempted to charge it for AWS services on account 550546298853. Please contact your bank to help resolve the payment failure.

We will no longer attempt to charge your card ending in 1714. Unless we are successful in collecting the balance due in full, your Amazon Web Services account may be suspended. If your account is suspended, you will not be able to access your data stored in the AWS services, manage existing resources, or buy new resources and any API calls you make to the AWS services will fail. To prevent suspension, go to your payments, select the invoices you want to pay, and complete the payment. Make sure that you pay all past-due invoices.
