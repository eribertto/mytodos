00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,580
hey YouTube welcome to the ipv4 subject

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:06,839
mastery video series this video series

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,120
will be all you need to become a sub

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,650
mini pro this is video 1 where we lay

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,479
the foundation we will answer the core

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,859
question what is submitting then talk

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,980
through every attribute you can extract

8
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,358
from a submitting problem first you want

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,660
to answer the question what is

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,310
submitting submitting is nothing more

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,160
than taking one network in dividing it

12
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:32,820
into sub networks for example this is

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:37,950
the 10.0.0.0 s from 10.0.0.0

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,590
through 10 not 0.025 5 this set of IP s

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,770
contains 256 IP addresses this is a

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,359
refer to as a slash 24 network if you're

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,570
unfamiliar with that terminology don't

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,340
worry it'll make more sense later the

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,840
process of subnetting is simply taking

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,870
one network and breaking it up into

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,239
smaller networks for instance I can take

22
00:00:54,869 --> 00:01:01,049
this slash 24 and break it up into two

23
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:06,868
equal slash 25 first 25 includes the IP

24
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:08,489
address 10.0.0.0 through dot 127 the

25
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:13,219
second slash 25 includes the IP

26
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:16,109
addresses 1000 128 through dot 255 I

27
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:20,489
could also break the slash 24 into four

28
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:22,379
equal parts or even eight equal parts in

29
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,719
each case I'm taking the original slash

30
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:28,629
24 network and dividing all 256

31
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:31,170
addresses into smaller sub networks

32
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:33,849
I also have the option to mix and match

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,549
here I've taken the original slash 24

34
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:41,259
and broke it up into a slash 25 to slash

35
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:43,118
27 and a slash 26 when you divide one

36
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,590
Network into sub networks there are

37
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,409
seven pieces of information you can

38
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,460
extract from each subnet every sub

39
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,259
earning problem you'll ever encounter

40
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:52,839
will require you to solve for one or

41
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,670
more of these seven items for the rest

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,649
of this video we will define what each

43
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,269
of these items are the rest of the

44
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:01,359
videos in this series will explain how

45
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:03,789
to solve for them we will start with the

46
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,140
bottom two the number of IP addresses is

47
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:07,420
simply the total number of addresses in

48
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,788
each block we mentioned earlier that the

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,909
original slash 24 had a total of 256

50
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,889
addresses we initially broke them up

51
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:18,609
into two equal halves which means each

52
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:20,318
hat contains 128 addresses then we broke

53
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,880
them up into eight equal sub networks

54
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,518
which means each slash twenty seven

55
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,439
contains 32 addresses that is all the

56
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,969
number of addresses are into simply the

57
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:29,969
total count of addresses in each subnet

58
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:37,150
we've been referring to sub networks as

59
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:40,000
slash 25s or / 26 s or / 27 this is

60
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,590
known as Sider notation a Sider notation

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,959
simply identifies the size of a

62
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,670
particular subnet there's another way to

63
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,739
define the size of the subnet and that

64
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,789
is known as the subnet mask you will

65
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,389
need to know how to convert between

66
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:54,939
subnet masks and Sider notation for

67
00:02:52,389 --> 00:03:00,549
example a slash 25 can be represented as

68
00:02:54,939 --> 00:03:05,250
the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 / 27 can

69
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:08,260
be represented as 255.255.255.0 4 in

70
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,568
both cases the cider or subnet mask

71
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:13,959
simply indicate the size of a particular

72
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:17,229
subnet or essentially the number of IP

73
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,699
addresses in each subnet something else

74
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:21,310
you'll need to know to solve for when

75
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:23,349
subnetting is the network ID the network

76
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,199
ID is simply the first possible address

77
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:30,098
in each subnet in our slash 25 this

78
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:32,619
would be the IP address 10.0.0.0 in our

79
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:36,518
slash 27 this is the IP address 10.0.0.0

80
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,069
in a you'll also need to solve for the

81
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,860
broadcast IP this is the last possible

82
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:45,759
address in each subnet for our slash 25

83
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:50,910
this would be 10.0.0.0 27 for our slash

84
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,909
27 this would be 10 not 0 dot 0 dot 189

85
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,740
both the network ID and the broadcast IP

86
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,640
serve a special purpose in each subnet

87
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,379
therefore they are not allowed to be

88
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,500
assigned to any user who is receiving an

89
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:08,139
IP address within the IP block for

90
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,560
example in the slash 25 users could be

91
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:13,239
assigned the IP address as down 16 dot

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:19,180
24.80 but they can't be assigned the IP

93
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:21,579
address as 10.0.0.0 or dot 127 which

94
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,819
means in the slash 25 there was a total

95
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:29,110
of 128 addresses but only 126 of them

96
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:31,540
are usable or in the slash 27 which had

97
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,919
a total of 32 addresses but only 30 of

98
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,689
them are usable to be assigned to hosts

99
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,399
the function of the network ID along

100
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:42,550
with the cider or subnet mask is to

101
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,620
identify a specific subnet for example

102
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:50,560
you can refer to this block of addresses

103
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,090
using the notation 10.00 128 / 27 be

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,319
careful though because the network ID

105
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:55,269
alone isn't enough

106
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,540
it must be coupled with the cider or

107
00:04:55,269 --> 00:05:03,639
mask for example if we use the network

108
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:07,330
ID 10.0.0.0 with a mask of slash 24 this

109
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,550
refers to all 256 addresses but if we

110
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:12,189
use the same network ID plane mask of

111
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:17,228
slash 25 this would refer to just this

112
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:19,209
chunk of 128 addresses broadcast IP is a

113
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:21,159
special address in each subnet that

114
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:24,668
allows the user to speak to every other

115
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,460
IP within the subnet for example if

116
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:29,259
there were 10 hosts in this / 25 network

117
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,299
I could speak to all of them at the same

118
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:36,459
time by sending a packet to the IP

119
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,228
address 10.0.0.0 nt7 now that we

120
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:40,478
understand what the network ID and

121
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:42,819
broadcast IP are and that they are not

122
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,349
usable as host addresses we can see the

123
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,409
importance of being able to solve for

124
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,820
the first host IP in the last host IP

125
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,860
these two values will give us our usable

126
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,468
IP range

127
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,259
first host IP is simply the IP address

128
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:59,579
immediately after the network ID in our

129
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:04,770
slash 25 our network idea was 10.0.0.0

130
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:08,978
therefore our first host IP is 10.0.0.0

131
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:12,038
7 our net ID was 10 not sort of 0.1 28

132
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:16,628
therefore our first host IP is 10 not 0

133
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:18,818
dot 0 dot 1 29 the last host IP is

134
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:21,789
simply the IP address immediately before

135
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:24,939
the broadcast IP in our slash 25 the

136
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:30,430
broadcast IP was dot 127 therefore our

137
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:33,278
last host IP is 1000 2000 slash 27 our

138
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:38,668
broadcast IP it was dot 159 therefore

139
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:40,839
our last host IP is 10.00 158 and

140
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:44,079
finally we've arrived to our last

141
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,968
attribute the next network the next

142
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,209
network is simply the network ID of the

143
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:51,158
subnet that follows for our slash 25 and

144
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:53,589
next subnet is this one right here and

145
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:59,168
the network ID of that subnet is

146
00:06:53,589 --> 00:07:05,709
10.0.0.0 28 therefore the slash 25 s

147
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:07,778
next network is 10.00 dot 128 but there

148
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:10,689
is also another potentially easier way

149
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:13,360
to solve for the next network notice the

150
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:16,870
slash 25 s next network of dot 128 was

151
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,490
exactly 1 more than the broadcast IP the

152
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,519
next network will always be the IP

153
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,949
address after the broadcast IP in our

154
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,649
slash 27 since the broadcast IP address

155
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:30,430
will stop 159 the next network would

156
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:32,318
consequently be dot 160 which indeed

157
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,038
would be the network ID of the following

158
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:40,050
subnet notice dot 160 is the first IP

159
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:42,310
address in the subsequent slash 27

160
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,560
these are the seven attributes of

161
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,990
subnetting hopefully now you understand

162
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,848
what each of them are every sub mini

163
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,650
question you'll ever receive will simply

164
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:54,639
require you to solve for one or more of

165
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:56,408
these seven items this video series will

166
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,870
illustrate a most efficient way to

167
00:07:56,408 --> 00:08:00,699
determine each of these attributes we

168
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,949
will be using a cheat sheet to simplify

169
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,540
the calculations the next video will

170
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,280
show you how to draw the cheat sheet

171
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,560
the video after that one will show you

172
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,029
how to use it with this cheat sheet and

173
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,100
the instructions in this video series

174
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:15,989
you'll be able to solve for all seven of

175
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,990
these attributes in 60 seconds or less

will be all you need to become a sub

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,650
mini pro this is video 1 where we lay

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,479
the foundation we will answer the core

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,859
question what is submitting then talk

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,980
through every attribute you can extract

8
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,358
from a submitting problem first you want

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,660
to answer the question what is

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,310
submitting submitting is nothing more

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,160
than taking one network in dividing it

12
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:32,820
into sub networks for example this is

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:37,950
the 10.0.0.0 s from 10.0.0.0

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,590
through 10 not 0.025 5 this set of IP s

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,770
contains 256 IP addresses this is a

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,359
refer to as a slash 24 network if you're

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,570
unfamiliar with that terminology don't

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,340
worry it'll make more sense later the

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,840
process of subnetting is simply taking

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,870
one network and breaking it up into

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,239
smaller networks for instance I can take

22
00:00:54,869 --> 00:01:01,049
this slash 24 and break it up into two

23
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:06,868
equal slash 25 first 25 includes the IP

24
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:08,489
address 10.0.0.0 through dot 127 the

25
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:13,219
second slash 25 includes the IP

26
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:16,109
addresses 1000 128 through dot 255 I

27
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:20,489
could also break the slash 24 into four

28
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:22,379
equal parts or even eight equal parts in

29
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,719
each case I'm taking the original slash

30
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:28,629
24 network and dividing all 256

31
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:31,170
addresses into smaller sub networks

32
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:33,849
I also have the option to mix and match

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,549
here I've taken the original slash 24

34
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:41,259
and broke it up into a slash 25 to slash

35
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:43,118
27 and a slash 26 when you divide one

36
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,590
Network into sub networks there are

37
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,409
seven pieces of information you can

38
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,460
extract from each subnet every sub

39
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,259
earning problem you'll ever encounter

40
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:52,839
will require you to solve for one or

41
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,670
more of these seven items for the rest

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,649
of this video we will define what each

43
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,269
of these items are the rest of the

44
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:01,359
videos in this series will explain how

45
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:03,789
to solve for them we will start with the

46
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,140
bottom two the number of IP addresses is

47
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:07,420
simply the total number of addresses in

48
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,788
each block we mentioned earlier that the

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,909
original slash 24 had a total of 256

50
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:14,889
addresses we initially broke them up

51
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:18,609
into two equal halves which means each

52
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:20,318
hat contains 128 addresses then we broke

53
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,880
them up into eight equal sub networks

54
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,518
which means each slash twenty seven

55
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,439
contains 32 addresses that is all the

56
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,969
number of addresses are into simply the

57
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:29,969
total count of addresses in each subnet

58
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:37,150
we've been referring to sub networks as

59
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:40,000
slash 25s or / 26 s or / 27 this is

60
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,590
known as Sider notation a Sider notation

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,959
simply identifies the size of a

62
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,670
particular subnet there's another way to

63
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,739
define the size of the subnet and that

64
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,789
is known as the subnet mask you will

65
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,389
need to know how to convert between

66
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:54,939
subnet masks and Sider notation for

67
00:02:52,389 --> 00:03:00,549
example a slash 25 can be represented as

68
00:02:54,939 --> 00:03:05,250
the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 / 27 can

69
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:08,260
be represented as 255.255.255.0 4 in

70
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,568
both cases the cider or subnet mask

71
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:13,959
simply indicate the size of a particular

72
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:17,229
subnet or essentially the number of IP

73
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,699
addresses in each subnet something else

74
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:21,310
you'll need to know to solve for when

75
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:23,349
subnetting is the network ID the network

76
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,199
ID is simply the first possible address

77
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:30,098
in each subnet in our slash 25 this

78
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:32,619
would be the IP address 10.0.0.0 in our

79
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:36,518
slash 27 this is the IP address 10.0.0.0

80
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,069
in a you'll also need to solve for the

81
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,860
broadcast IP this is the last possible

82
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:45,759
address in each subnet for our slash 25

83
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:50,910
this would be 10.0.0.0 27 for our slash

84
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,909
27 this would be 10 not 0 dot 0 dot 189

85
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,740
both the network ID and the broadcast IP

86
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,640
serve a special purpose in each subnet

87
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,379
therefore they are not allowed to be

88
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,500
assigned to any user who is receiving an

89
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:08,139
IP address within the IP block for

90
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,560
example in the slash 25 users could be

91
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:13,239
assigned the IP address as down 16 dot

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:19,180
24.80 but they can't be assigned the IP

93
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:21,579
address as 10.0.0.0 or dot 127 which

94
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,819
means in the slash 25 there was a total

95
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:29,110
of 128 addresses but only 126 of them

96
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:31,540
are usable or in the slash 27 which had

97
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,919
a total of 32 addresses but only 30 of

98
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,689
them are usable to be assigned to hosts

99
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,399
the function of the network ID along

100
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:42,550
with the cider or subnet mask is to

101
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,620
identify a specific subnet for example

102
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:50,560
you can refer to this block of addresses

103
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,090
using the notation 10.00 128 / 27 be

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,319
careful though because the network ID

105
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:55,269
alone isn't enough

106
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,540
it must be coupled with the cider or

107
00:04:55,269 --> 00:05:03,639
mask for example if we use the network

108
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:07,330
ID 10.0.0.0 with a mask of slash 24 this

109
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,550
refers to all 256 addresses but if we

110
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:12,189
use the same network ID plane mask of

111
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:17,228
slash 25 this would refer to just this

112
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:19,209
chunk of 128 addresses broadcast IP is a

113
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:21,159
special address in each subnet that

114
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:24,668
allows the user to speak to every other

115
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,460
IP within the subnet for example if

116
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:29,259
there were 10 hosts in this / 25 network

117
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,299
I could speak to all of them at the same

118
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:36,459
time by sending a packet to the IP

119
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,228
address 10.0.0.0 nt7 now that we

120
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:40,478
understand what the network ID and

121
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:42,819
broadcast IP are and that they are not

122
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,349
usable as host addresses we can see the

123
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,409
importance of being able to solve for

124
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,820
the first host IP in the last host IP

125
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,860
these two values will give us our usable

126
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,468
IP range

127
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,259
first host IP is simply the IP address

128
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:59,579
immediately after the network ID in our

129
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:04,770
slash 25 our network idea was 10.0.0.0

130
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:08,978
therefore our first host IP is 10.0.0.0

131
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:12,038
7 our net ID was 10 not sort of 0.1 28

132
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:16,628
therefore our first host IP is 10 not 0

133
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:18,818
dot 0 dot 1 29 the last host IP is

134
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:21,789
simply the IP address immediately before

135
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:24,939
the broadcast IP in our slash 25 the

136
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:30,430
broadcast IP was dot 127 therefore our

137
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:33,278
last host IP is 1000 2000 slash 27 our

138
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:38,668
broadcast IP it was dot 159 therefore

139
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:40,839
our last host IP is 10.00 158 and

140
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:44,079
finally we've arrived to our last

141
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,968
attribute the next network the next

142
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,209
network is simply the network ID of the

143
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:51,158
subnet that follows for our slash 25 and

144
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:53,589
next subnet is this one right here and

145
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:59,168
the network ID of that subnet is

146
00:06:53,589 --> 00:07:05,709
10.0.0.0 28 therefore the slash 25 s

147
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:07,778
next network is 10.00 dot 128 but there

148
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:10,689
is also another potentially easier way

149
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:13,360
to solve for the next network notice the

150
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:16,870
slash 25 s next network of dot 128 was

151
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,490
exactly 1 more than the broadcast IP the

152
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,519
next network will always be the IP

153
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,949
address after the broadcast IP in our

154
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,649
slash 27 since the broadcast IP address

155
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:30,430
will stop 159 the next network would

156
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:32,318
consequently be dot 160 which indeed

157
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,038
would be the network ID of the following

158
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:40,050
subnet notice dot 160 is the first IP

159
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:42,310
address in the subsequent slash 27

160
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,560
these are the seven attributes of

161
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,990
subnetting hopefully now you understand

162
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,848
what each of them are every sub mini

163
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,650
question you'll ever receive will simply

164
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:54,639
require you to solve for one or more of

165
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:56,408
these seven items this video series will

166
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,870
illustrate a most efficient way to

167
00:07:56,408 --> 00:08:00,699
determine each of these attributes we

168
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,949
will be using a cheat sheet to simplify

169
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,540
the calculations the next video will

170

show you how to draw the cheat sheet

171
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,560
the video after that one will show you

172
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,029
how to use it with this cheat sheet and

173
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,100
the instructions in this video series

174
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:15,989
you'll be able to solve for all seven of

175
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,990
these attributes in 60 seconds or less

you solve so many questions in 60

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,138
seconds or less we will use those cheat

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,710
sheet throughout the rest of this video

8
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,939
series let's get started rather than

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,528
just show you the cheat sheet I'm going

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,150
to show you how to draw it if you're

11
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:22,800
taking a certification exam you can't

12
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:23,849
bring notes so being able to quickly

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,949
write out the cheat sheet is very

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,449
important if you just want to learn how

15
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,368
to use the cheat sheet go ahead and skip

16
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,840
to the next video otherwise there are

17
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:34,229
only three steps to drawing the cheat

18
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,509
sheet the first step is to start with

19
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:40,339
one and keep doubling until you hit 128

20
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,339
this must be done from right to the left

21
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:47,820
the next step is to subtract the top row

22
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:53,140
from 256 for example 256 minus 1 is 255

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,450
256 minus 2 is 254 256 minus 4 is 252

24
00:00:53,140 --> 00:01:00,280
and so on when you're done it'll look

25
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:02,050
like this last step is to write out the

26
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,478
Sider notations from right to left

27
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:07,239
starting at 32 and going down start with

28
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,390
slash 32 and then continue to slash 31 /

29
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:13,959
30 / 29 and so on when you're finished

30
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:16,180
it'll look like this these three rows

31
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,099
make up the subheading cheat sheet using

32
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,649
this table you can solve any submitting

33
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:22,750
problem in 60 seconds or less each row

34
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:26,049
represents something different the first

35
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,939
row I'll refer to as the group size the

36
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,920
second row will be our subnet mask and

37
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:32,469
the last row will be our Sider notation

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,478
in the next video I'll show you how to

39
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:36,129
use this table to solve for any of the

40
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,868
seven submitting attributes we discussed

keystone of the series in video 3 we

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,789
will learn how to use a cheat sheet to

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:17,368
solve so many problems these are the

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,778
seven attributes of subnetting every sub

8
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,320
for one or more of these seven items if

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,820
you want to know what each of these

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,879
items are please check out the first

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,920
video in this series this is the

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,410
subnetting cheat sheet we will use this

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,730
table to solve any sub many problems if

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,469
you want to know the three steps to

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,890
create this table please check out video

16
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,750
2 in this video we will show you how to

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,340
use a cheat sheet to solve all seven

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,329
attributes for any combination of IP

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,149
address and mask in 60 seconds or less

20
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:51,058
our first example problem will be

21
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:55,079
10.1.1.10 5 / 28 we'll find all seven

22
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,459
attributes for this IP and mask we will

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,460
start by learning how to quickly convert

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,899
from a setter notation to subnet mask

25
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,480
our example problem provided a Sider

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,909
notation of / 28 we will use that to

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,859
find our column in the cheat sheet since

28
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,760
we were given a / 28 this puts us in

29
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,650
this column within our column the site

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,719
or row will map to the subnet row The

31
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,118
Cider notation / 28 will map to the

32
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:23,810
subject value of 240 which means our

33
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,810
subnet mask will be 255 255 255 255

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,079
for our problem with a / 28 the group

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,270
size will be 16 then we will start at

36
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,359
dot 0 and continue incrementing by the

37
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:41,879
group size until we pass a target IP so

38
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:44,430
we all have dot 0 dot 16 dot 30 2.48 dot

39
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,519
64 and at this point we've passed our

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,899
target IP of dot 55 the dot 55 would

41
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,750
exist somewhere between these two

42
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,640
numbers what we just did was the hardest

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,478
part from here we can simply fill out

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,849
the remaining attributes the number

45
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:05,310
before our target IP is our network ID

46
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:07,530
this makes our network ID 10.1.1.1 umber

47
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,390
after our target IP is our next network

48
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,390
this makes our next network

49
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:20,669
our next network is our broadcast IP

50
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:20,669
this makes our broadcast IP 10.11

51
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,130
just like that we were able to easily

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,450
solve for 3 more of the seven attributes

53
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:33,250
solving for the last three will be just

54
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:36,250
as easy to find our first host IP simply

55
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,139
add one to the network ID if dot 48 was

56
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,879
our network ID then our first host must

57
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:45,250
be 10.1.1.1 to find the last host IP

58
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,459
simply subtract 1 from the broadcast IP

59
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:54,310
if dot 63 was our broadcast IP then our

60
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:56,650
last host must be 10.1.1.1 'le the

61
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,599
number of IP addresses is very easy the

62
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,270
number of IP addresses is the same as

63
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,989
the group size for our slash 28 the

64
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,090
number of IPS is 16 keep in mind this is

65
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,680
the total number of addresses remember

66
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,750
that the network ID and the broadcast IP

67
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,459
are not usable addresses so if you're

68
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,430
trying to solve for the number of usable

69
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:18,069
addresses don't forget to subtract 2 for

70
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:23,140
our slash 28 we would have 14 usable

71
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:25,079
addresses we will run through the same

72
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,609
process with another example problem

73
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,480
this time we will solve for all seven

74
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:35,380
attributes for the IP and mask 10.1.1.10

75
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:37,389
slash 29 as before we will start with

76
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:39,069
converting between cider and mask we

77
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:40,599
were provided to slash twenty-nine we

78
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:44,049
will use that to determine that we are

79
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,090
in this call a cider and subnet mask

80
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,810
rows mapped to each other so we know

81
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,900
that a slash twenty-nine Maps 2.2 for 8

82
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:56,110
which gives us a sub damask of

83
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,969
255.255.255.0 for 8 then we will locate

84
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,000
our group size which for this problem

85
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:03,039
will be 8 as before we'll start with dot

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,829
0 and increment by the group size until

87
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:12,789
we pass a target IP dot 0 dot 8.16 dot

88
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:16,120
twenty 4.30 2.40 we've now passed the

89
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:19,209
target IP so we can stop there dot 37

90
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,129
who exists somewhere in here once again

91
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,090
this was the hard part from here we can

92
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:26,939
just fill everything in the number of

93
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:30,199
for our target IP is our

94
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:33,600
work ID this makes our network ID

95
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:36,240
10.1.1.10 umber after our target IP is

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,770
our next network this makes our next

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,560
network 10.1.1.10 p address before our

98
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:49,229
next network is our broadcast IP this

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:51,750
makes our broadcast IP 10.1.1.10 to find

100
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:54,689
the first host IP we simply add one to

101
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,069
the network ID if dot 32 was our network

102
00:04:54,689 --> 00:05:02,399
ID then our first host IP must be

103
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:05,399
10.1.1.10 our last host IP simply

104
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,009
subtract 1 from the broadcast IP if dot

105
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:14,129
39 was our broadcast IP then our last

106
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:16,560
host must be 10.1.1.1 aliy our group

107
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:19,980
size was 8 therefore our total number of

108
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,420
IP addresses was also 8 as before if we

109
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,890
were trying to find the usable number of

110
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,390
addresses we would simply subtract 2

111
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,669
there you have it that is the process to

112
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,979
solve for all seven attributes using the

113
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,080
cheat sheet as with anything this will

114
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,640
take some practice the next video in the

115
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,589
series provides for more practice

116
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,120
examples two of them will be easier

117
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:41,279
prompts and the other two will be a

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,740
little trickier once you've watched both

119
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,750
video 3 and video 4 you'll have a solid

120
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,129
understanding of the process and you'll

121
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,180
be that much closer to becoming the

122
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,180
submitting master

124
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,480
you

1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:06,209
hey YouTube welcome to the ipv4 subnet

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,580
mask video series this video is the

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,019
keystone of the series in video 3 we

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,789
will learn how to use a cheat sheet to

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:17,368
solve so many problems these are the

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,778
seven attributes of subnetting every sub

7
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,000
dating question will require you solve

8
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,320
for one or more of these seven items if

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,820
you want to know what each of these

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,879
items are please check out the first

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,920
video in this series this is the

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,410
subnetting cheat sheet we will use this

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,730
table to solve any sub many problems if

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,469
you want to know the three steps to

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,890
create this table please check out video

16
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,750
2 in this video we will show you how to

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,340
use a cheat sheet to solve all seven

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,329
attributes for any combination of IP

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,149
address and mask in 60 seconds or less

20
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:51,058
our first example problem will be

21
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:55,079
10.1.1.10 5 / 28 we'll find all seven

22
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,459
attributes for this IP and mask we will

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,460
start by learning how to quickly convert

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,899
from a setter notation to subnet mask

25
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,480
our example problem provided a Sider

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,909
notation of / 28 we will use that to

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,859
find our column in the cheat sheet since

28
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,760
we were given a / 28 this puts us in

29
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,650
this column within our column the site

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,719
or row will map to the subnet row The

31
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,118
Cider notation / 28 will map to the

32
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:23,810
subject value of 240 which means our

33
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,810
subnet mask will be 255 255 255 255

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,079
for our problem with a / 28 the group

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,270
size will be 16 then we will start at

36
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,359
dot 0 and continue incrementing by the

37
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:41,879
group size until we pass a target IP so

38
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:44,430
we all have dot 0 dot 16 dot 30 2.48 dot

39
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,519
64 and at this point we've passed our

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,899
target IP of dot 55 the dot 55 would

41
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,750
exist somewhere between these two

42
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,640
numbers what we just did was the hardest

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,478
part from here we can simply fill out

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,849
the remaining attributes the number

45
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:05,310
before our target IP is our network ID

46
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:07,530
this makes our network ID 10.1.1.1 umber

47
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,390
after our target IP is our next network

48
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,390
this makes our next network

49
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:20,669
our next network is our broadcast IP

50
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:20,669
this makes our broadcast IP 10.11

51
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,130
just like that we were able to easily

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,450
solve for 3 more of the seven attributes

53
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:33,250
solving for the last three will be just

54
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:36,250
as easy to find our first host IP simply

55
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,139
add one to the network ID if dot 48 was

56
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,879
our network ID then our first host must

57
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:45,250
be 10.1.1.1 to find the last host IP

58
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,459
simply subtract 1 from the broadcast IP

59
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:54,310
if dot 63 was our broadcast IP then our

60
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:56,650
last host must be 10.1.1.1 'le the

61
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,599
number of IP addresses is very easy the

62
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,270
number of IP addresses is the same as

63
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,989
the group size for our slash 28 the

64
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,090
number of IPS is 16 keep in mind this is

65
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,680
the total number of addresses remember

66
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,750
that the network ID and the broadcast IP

67
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,459
are not usable addresses so if you're

68
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,430
trying to solve for the number of usable

69
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:18,069
addresses don't forget to subtract 2 for

70
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:23,140
our slash 28 we would have 14 usable

71
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:25,079
addresses we will run through the same

72
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,609
process with another example problem

73
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,480
this time we will solve for all seven

74
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:35,380
attributes for the IP and mask 10.1.1.10

75
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:37,389
slash 29 as before we will start with

76
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:39,069
converting between cider and mask we

77
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:40,599
were provided to slash twenty-nine we

78
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:44,049
will use that to determine that we are

79
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,090
in this call a cider and subnet mask

80
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,810
rows mapped to each other so we know

81
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,900
that a slash twenty-nine Maps 2.2 for 8

82
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:56,110
which gives us a sub damask of

83
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,969
255.255.255.0 for 8 then we will locate

84
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,000
our group size which for this problem

85
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:03,039
will be 8 as before we'll start with dot

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,829
0 and increment by the group size until

87
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:12,789
we pass a target IP dot 0 dot 8.16 dot

88
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:16,120
twenty 4.30 2.40 we've now passed the

89
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:19,209
target IP so we can stop there dot 37

90
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,129
who exists somewhere in here once again

91
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,090
this was the hard part from here we can

92
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:26,939
just fill everything in the number of

93
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:30,199
for our target IP is our

94
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:33,600
work ID this makes our network ID

95
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:36,240
10.1.1.10 umber after our target IP is

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,770
our next network this makes our next

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,560
network 10.1.1.10 p address before our

98
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:49,229
next network is our broadcast IP this

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:51,750
makes our broadcast IP 10.1.1.10 to find

100
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:54,689
the first host IP we simply add one to

101
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,069
the network ID if dot 32 was our network

102
00:04:54,689 --> 00:05:02,399
ID then our first host IP must be

103
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:05,399
10.1.1.10 our last host IP simply

104
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,009
subtract 1 from the broadcast IP if dot

105
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:14,129
39 was our broadcast IP then our last

106
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:16,560
host must be 10.1.1.1 aliy our group

107
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:19,980
size was 8 therefore our total number of

108
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,420
IP addresses was also 8 as before if we

109
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,890
were trying to find the usable number of

110
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,390
addresses we would simply subtract 2

111
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,669
there you have it that is the process to

112
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,979
solve for all seven attributes using the

113
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,080
cheat sheet as with anything this will

114
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,640
take some practice the next video in the

115
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,589
series provides for more practice

116
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,120
examples two of them will be easier

117
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:41,279
prompts and the other two will be a

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,740
little trickier once you've watched both

119
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,750
video 3 and video 4 you'll have a solid

120
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,129
understanding of the process and you'll

121
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,180
be that much closer to becoming the

00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,969
to video 4 in this video we go through a

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:10,500
few more practice problems to further

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,839
demonstrate how to solve submitting

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,519
problems if you consider yourself

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,138
proficient at submitting definitely at

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,059
least check out the final two problems

9
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,528
in this video they illustrate how to

10
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,618
work through some potentially confusing

11
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,179
situations in video 1 the illustrated

12
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,820
the 7 attributes you can derive from a

13
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,320
subheading problem in video 2 we covered

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,960
how to create the submitting cheat sheet

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,488
in video 3 we talked through these seven

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,380
steps to use the cheat sheet to solve

17
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,939
for all the attributes for more details

18
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,170
on any of these please check out those

19
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:41,729
respective videos in this video we will

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,170
simply run through the process four more

21
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,479
times to give you additional practice

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,370
and exposure to using the cheat sheet we

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,109
will do two easy problems and then two

24
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:52,409
problems with pacific peculiarities you

25
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:56,750
might run into in the real world our

26
00:00:52,409 --> 00:01:00,390
first problem will be 10.2 to 80 8/27

27
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:03,539
this prom provides a Sider of / 27 which

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,579
puts us in this column the subnet row in

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:10,040
our column lists two to four which means

30
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:12,810
our subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 to four

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,810
then we will locate our group size for a

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,180
/ 27 the group size is 32 and we will

33
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,469
start at dot 0 and continue incrementing

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,580
by 32 until we pass the target IP so we

35
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:30,000
have dot 0 then dot 30 2.64 dot 96 and

36
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,530
here we've passed our target IP of 88 at

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,109
this point we can just fill in all the

38
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,478
remaining attributes the number before

39
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:40,590
our target IP is the network ID which

40
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,810
makes our network ID 10.2 2.64 the

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,579
number after our target IP is the next

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,530
network which makes our next network

43
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:51,809
10.2 to 96 the IP address before the

44
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,579
next network is our broadcast IP which

45
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,649
makes our broadcast IP 10.2 to 95 the IP

46
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,929
address after the network ID is our

47
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,939
first house IP which makes our first

48
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:08,580
host IP 10.2 2.65 the IP before our

49
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:12,199
broadcast IP is the last host IP which

50
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,890
makes our last host IP 10.2 to 94 and

51
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,568
finally our group

52
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,119
sighs is our total number of addresses

53
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:21,869
our group size was 32 which means there

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,009
are 32 total addresses in a / 27 if we

55
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,390
were being asked for the number of

56
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,909
usable addresses we would simply

57
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:31,409
subtract to giving us 30 usable

58
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:35,699
addresses in a / 27 our next example

59
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:38,009
problem will be 10.22 111 / 25 the

60
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:41,159
prompt provides a Sider of / 25 which

61
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:43,109
puts us in this column the subnet row in

62
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,539
this column lists 128 which means our

63
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,580
subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 28 then we

64
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,549
will locate our group size for a / 25

65
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,310
the group size is 128 then we'll start

66
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,969
at down 0 and increment by 128 until we

67
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,680
pass our target IP dot 0 dot 128 and

68
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:05,340
here in our first increment we've

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,540
already passed dot 111 at this point we

70
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,959
can just fill in all the remaining

71
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:13,620
attributes the number before our target

72
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,780
epi is our network ID 10.2 2.0 the

73
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,799
number after our target IP is our next

74
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:23,099
network 10 not 2.2.1 28 the IP address

75
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,010
before our next network is 10.2 - 127

76
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,930
which is our broadcast IP our first host

77
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:31,078
IP is the number after the network ID

78
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,360
which makes our first host IP 10 - 2.1

79
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,159
and our last host IP is the number

80
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,720
before the broadcast IP which makes our

81
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:41,909
last host IP 10.2 - 126 finally our

82
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,099
group size of 128 is also the total

83
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,569
number of addresses and again if we're

84
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,479
being asked for the usable dresses we'd

85
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,120
simply subtract you giving us 128 total

86
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:56,099
addresses or 126 useable addresses in a

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,989
/ 25 and there you have two more

88
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,639
examples of how to solve for all seven

89
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,009
attributes of subnetting using the cheat

90
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,469
sheet and these steps next we're gonna

91
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,179
run through two more problems these two

92
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:08,129
problems will show you situations that

93
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,659
if not for us talking through them could

94
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:14,099
lead to confusion let's get to it

95
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:17,219
we'll start off the same way we are

96
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,819
provided 10.22 20 in a cider notation of

97
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,880
/ 30 which puts us in this column the /

98
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:27,348
30 lists 252 in the subnet row giving us

99
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,348
a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:37,590
do our group size 4/30 is 4 so you'll

101
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:42,870
start at dot zero and increment by 4.0.4

102
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:45,239
dot eight dot 12.16 dot 20 notice our

103
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,730
target IP is 20 and we've just hit dot

104
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,470
twenty but notice the instructions say

105
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,720
you must continue until you pass the

106
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,380
target @p which means we have to go one

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,880
more increment 2.24 what you are doing

108
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,769
when you are listing all these values

109
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,629
based upon the group sizes increment is

110
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:03,599
listing the network IDs for every slash

111
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:06,449
30 sub network within the 10.2 2x

112
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,820
network when we landed on dot 20 this

113
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,819
tells us our target IP is the network ID

114
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,400
from this point we can continue as

115
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,969
normal to solve for the remaining

116
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:22,529
attributes the number after our target

117
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,480
IP is our next network 10.2 to 24 the IP

118
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:28,319
address before our next network is 10

119
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,210
not 2.2 23 which is our broadcast IP our

120
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,129
first host IP is the number after the

121
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:35,849
network ID which makes our first host IP

122
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:37,980
10.2 to 21 in our last host IP is the

123
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:42,290
number before the broadcast IP which

124
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:45,240
makes our last host IP 10 not to 2.22

125
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,879
finally our group size of 4 is also the

126
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,680
total number of addresses the key

127
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,860
takeaway from this prom is to highlight

128
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,470
step 1 D increment by a group size until

129
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,120
you pass the target IP if you don't

130
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,010
you'll end up solving for the 7

131
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,840
attributes of the wrong sub network all

132
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,209
right we've reached the final problem of

133
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:11,009
this video we will solve all seven

134
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:13,439
attributes for 10.22 199 / 26 it'll

135
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,599
start like any other problem we will use

136
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,879
the provided cider or mask to find the

137
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,490
respective column then we will find the

138
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:25,649
appropriate subnet mask for us a / 26

139
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:28,879
maps to the mask 255.255.255.0 92 then

140
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:31,889
we will find the group size for us at 64

141
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:36,540
we will then start incrementing from 0

142
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:40,919
until we pass the target IP dot 0 dot 64

143
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:43,810
dot 128 dot 192 dot 256 but

144
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,879
2:56 is not a valid IP address each

145
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,569
octet in an IP address can only be from

146
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,250
zero to dot 255 so even though 256 is

147
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:53,189
the next increment you can't simply

148
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,480
write 256 and continue from there

149
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:57,969
instead you have to increase the next

150
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,800
octet as we said in the last problem

151
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,990
with this increment you're listing out

152
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,129
the network ID for each slash 26 sub

153
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:08,050
network starting from 10 not to 2.0 if

154
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,699
we fill in the remaining octet for each

155
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,290
increment we can see this more plainly

156
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:18,610
this isn't just dot 0 it is 10.22 0 and

157
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:21,819
this isn't just dot 64 it is 10.2 2.64

158
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,620
and so on which means when we get to a

159
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:27,009
place where we would have to increase to

160
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:30,819
256 we can instead set that octet 2.0

161
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:34,289
and increase the next octet by 1 so the

162
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:37,420
next IP in this series would be 10.2.32

163
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:41,410
if we needed to continue we would

164
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,970
proceed to 10.2.32 4 but we don't have

165
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:48,580
to because we've already passed our

166
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:50,500
target IP which was 10.2 2 dot 199 once

167
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:52,779
we've passed our target IP the process

168
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,389
continues as normal the number before

169
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:59,289
our target IP is our network ID which

170
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:01,599
makes our network ID 10.22 192 the

171
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,669
number after our target IP is our next

172
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,600
network that makes our next network 10

173
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:09,459
not 2.30 to solve the broadcast IP

174
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,350
remember we are looking for the IP

175
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:15,819
address immediately before the next

176
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:18,870
network our next network was 10.2.32

177
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:24,099
and the IP right before that is 10.2 to

178
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:26,980
255 our first host IP is the number

179
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,129
after the network ID which is 10.2 to

180
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,590
193 our last host IP is the number

181
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:37,418
before the broadcast IP which makes our

182
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:39,519
last host 10 not 2 2 2 5 4 lastly our

183
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:41,649
group size is also the total number of

184
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,419
IP addresses which gives us a total of

185
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:48,189
64 IP addresses in a / 26 the key

186
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,899
takeaway from this problem is to

187
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,520
understand how to continue incrementing

188
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:55,149
into the next octet if

189
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,679
necessary at this point you've seen the

190
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:59,919
process of going through these steps six

191
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,599
times now it's your turn open a web

192
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,289
browser and navigate to pregnant annette

193
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,820
slash submit

194
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,679
you'll be taken to a subnetting problem

195
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,350
generator that asks you to solve five of

196
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,969
the attributes we discussed the form

197
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,470
allows you to input your answers check

198
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,389
your work and show correct answers

199
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,740
you can also type in your own problems

200
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:22,279
if you want to practice with a specific

201
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,840
IP or mask see if you can get your

202
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,389
timing down to around a minute to run

203
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,500
through all seven steps once you work

204
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:29,750
through a few problems on your own

205
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,159
you'll be ready to watch video 5 in the

206
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,389
next video I'll show you four tricks

207
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:35,709
that will allow you to solve for all

208
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:35,710

00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,969
to video 4 in this video we go through a

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:10,500
few more practice problems to further

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,839
demonstrate how to solve submitting

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,519
problems if you consider yourself

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,138
proficient at submitting definitely at

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,059
least check out the final two problems

9
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,528
in this video they illustrate how to

10
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,618
work through some potentially confusing

11
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,179
situations in video 1 the illustrated

12
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,820
the 7 attributes you can derive from a

13
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,320
subheading problem in video 2 we covered

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,960
how to create the submitting cheat sheet

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,488
in video 3 we talked through these seven

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,380
steps to use the cheat sheet to solve

17
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,939
for all the attributes for more details

18
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,170
on any of these please check out those

19
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:41,729
respective videos in this video we will

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,170
simply run through the process four more

21
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,479
times to give you additional practice

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,370
and exposure to using the cheat sheet we

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,109
will do two easy problems and then two

24
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:52,409
problems with pacific peculiarities you

25
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:56,750
might run into in the real world our

26
00:00:52,409 --> 00:01:00,390
first problem will be 10.2 to 80 8/27

27
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:03,539
this prom provides a Sider of / 27 which

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,579
puts us in this column the subnet row in

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:10,040
our column lists two to four which means

30
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:12,810
our subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 to four

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,810
then we will locate our group size for a

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,180
/ 27 the group size is 32 and we will

33
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,469
start at dot 0 and continue incrementing

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:26,580
by 32 until we pass the target IP so we

35
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:30,000
have dot 0 then dot 30 2.64 dot 96 and

36
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,530
here we've passed our target IP of 88 at

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,109
this point we can just fill in all the

38
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,478
remaining attributes the number before

39
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:40,590
our target IP is the network ID which

40
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:42,810
makes our network ID 10.2 2.64 the

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,579
number after our target IP is the next

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,530
network which makes our next network

43
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:51,809
10.2 to 96 the IP address before the

44
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,579
next network is our broadcast IP which

45
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,649
makes our broadcast IP 10.2 to 95 the IP

46
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,929
address after the network ID is our

47
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,939
first house IP which makes our first

48
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:08,580
host IP 10.2 2.65 the IP before our

49
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:12,199
broadcast IP is the last host IP which

50
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,890
makes our last host IP 10.2 to 94 and

51
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,568
finally our group

52
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,119
sighs is our total number of addresses

53
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:21,869
our group size was 32 which means there

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,009
are 32 total addresses in a / 27 if we

55
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,390
were being asked for the number of

56
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,909
usable addresses we would simply

57
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:31,409
subtract to giving us 30 usable

58
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:35,699
addresses in a / 27 our next example

59
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:38,009
problem will be 10.22 111 / 25 the

60
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:41,159
prompt provides a Sider of / 25 which

61
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:43,109
puts us in this column the subnet row in

62
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,539
this column lists 128 which means our

63
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,580
subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 28 then we

64
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,549
will locate our group size for a / 25

65
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,310
the group size is 128 then we'll start

66
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,969
at down 0 and increment by 128 until we

67
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,680
pass our target IP dot 0 dot 128 and

68
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:05,340
here in our first increment we've

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,540
already passed dot 111 at this point we

70
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,959
can just fill in all the remaining

71
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:13,620
attributes the number before our target

72
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,780
epi is our network ID 10.2 2.0 the

73
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,799
number after our target IP is our next

74
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:23,099
network 10 not 2.2.1 28 the IP address

75
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,010
before our next network is 10.2 - 127

76
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,930
which is our broadcast IP our first host

77
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:31,078
IP is the number after the network ID

78
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,360
which makes our first host IP 10 - 2.1

79
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,159
and our last host IP is the number

80
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,720
before the broadcast IP which makes our

81
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:41,909
last host IP 10.2 - 126 finally our

82
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,099
group size of 128 is also the total

83
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,569
number of addresses and again if we're

84
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,479
being asked for the usable dresses we'd

85
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,120
simply subtract you giving us 128 total

86
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:56,099
addresses or 126 useable addresses in a

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,989
/ 25 and there you have two more

88
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,639
examples of how to solve for all seven

89
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,009
attributes of subnetting using the cheat

90
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,469
sheet and these steps next we're gonna

91
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,179
run through two more problems these two

92
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:08,129
problems will show you situations that

93
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,659
if not for us talking through them could

94
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:14,099
lead to confusion let's get to it

95
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:17,219
we'll start off the same way we are

96
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,819
provided 10.22 20 in a cider notation of

97
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,880
/ 30 which puts us in this column the /

98
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:27,348
30 lists 252 in the subnet row giving us

99
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,348
a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:37,590
do our group size 4/30 is 4 so you'll

101
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:42,870
start at dot zero and increment by 4.0.4

102
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:45,239
dot eight dot 12.16 dot 20 notice our

103
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,730
target IP is 20 and we've just hit dot

104
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,470
twenty but notice the instructions say

105
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,720
you must continue until you pass the

106
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,380
target @p which means we have to go one

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,880
more increment 2.24 what you are doing

108
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,769
when you are listing all these values

109
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,629
based upon the group sizes increment is

110
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:03,599
listing the network IDs for every slash

111
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:06,449
30 sub network within the 10.2 2x

112
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,820
network when we landed on dot 20 this

113
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,819
tells us our target IP is the network ID

114
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,400
from this point we can continue as

115
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,969
normal to solve for the remaining

116
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:22,529
attributes the number after our target

117
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,480
IP is our next network 10.2 to 24 the IP

118
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:28,319
address before our next network is 10

119
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,210
not 2.2 23 which is our broadcast IP our

120
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,129
first host IP is the number after the

121
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:35,849
network ID which makes our first host IP

122
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:37,980
10.2 to 21 in our last host IP is the

123
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:42,290
number before the broadcast IP which

124
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:45,240
makes our last host IP 10 not to 2.22

125
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,879
finally our group size of 4 is also the

126
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,680
total number of addresses the key

127
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,860
takeaway from this prom is to highlight

128
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,470
step 1 D increment by a group size until

129
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,120
you pass the target IP if you don't

130
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,010
you'll end up solving for the 7

131
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,840
attributes of the wrong sub network all

132
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,209
right we've reached the final problem of

133
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:11,009
this video we will solve all seven

134
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:13,439
attributes for 10.22 199 / 26 it'll

135
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,599
start like any other problem we will use

136
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,879
the provided cider or mask to find the

137
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,490
respective column then we will find the

138
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:25,649
appropriate subnet mask for us a / 26

139
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:28,879
maps to the mask 255.255.255.0 92 then

140
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:31,889
we will find the group size for us at 64

141
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:36,540
we will then start incrementing from 0

142
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:40,919
until we pass the target IP dot 0 dot 64

143
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:43,810
dot 128 dot 192 dot 256 but

144
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,879
2:56 is not a valid IP address each

145
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,569
octet in an IP address can only be from

146
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,250
zero to dot 255 so even though 256 is

147
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:53,189
the next increment you can't simply

148
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,480
write 256 and continue from there

149
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:57,969
instead you have to increase the next

150
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,800
octet as we said in the last problem

151
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,990
with this increment you're listing out

152
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,129
the network ID for each slash 26 sub

153
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:08,050
network starting from 10 not to 2.0 if

154
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,699
we fill in the remaining octet for each

155
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,290
increment we can see this more plainly

156
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:18,610
this isn't just dot 0 it is 10.22 0 and

157
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:21,819
this isn't just dot 64 it is 10.2 2.64

158
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,620
and so on which means when we get to a

159
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:27,009
place where we would have to increase to

160
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:30,819
256 we can instead set that octet 2.0

161
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:34,289
and increase the next octet by 1 so the

162
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:37,420
next IP in this series would be 10.2.32

163
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:41,410
if we needed to continue we would

164
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,970
proceed to 10.2.32 4 but we don't have

165
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:48,580
to because we've already passed our

166
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:50,500
target IP which was 10.2 2 dot 199 once

167
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:52,779
we've passed our target IP the process

168
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,389
continues as normal the number before

169
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:59,289
our target IP is our network ID which

170
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:01,599
makes our network ID 10.22 192 the

171
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,669
number after our target IP is our next

172
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,600
network that makes our next network 10

173
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:09,459
not 2.30 to solve the broadcast IP

174
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,350
remember we are looking for the IP

175
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:15,819
address immediately before the next

176
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:18,870
network our next network was 10.2.32

177
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:24,099
and the IP right before that is 10.2 to

178
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:26,980
255 our first host IP is the number

179
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,129
after the network ID which is 10.2 to

180
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,590
193 our last host IP is the number

181
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:37,418
before the broadcast IP which makes our

182
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:39,519
last host 10 not 2 2 2 5 4 lastly our

183
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:41,649
group size is also the total number of

184
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,419
IP addresses which gives us a total of

185
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:48,189
64 IP addresses in a / 26 the key

186
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,899
takeaway from this problem is to

187
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,520
understand how to continue incrementing

188
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:55,149
into the next octet if

189
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,679
necessary at this point you've seen the

190
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:59,919
process of going through these steps six

191
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,599
times now it's your turn open a web

192
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,289
browser and navigate to pregnant annette

193
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,820
slash submit

194
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,679
you'll be taken to a subnetting problem

195
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,350

204
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:29,750
through a few problems on your own

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,368
already watched at least video 1 to

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,320

the 7 steps to solve for each attribute

13
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,990
I also highly recommend to have watch

cheat sheet and video 4 to get more

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,140
practice using the cheat sheet with that

17
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,719
said let's show you four tips to

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,219
increase your subtending speed we will

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,629
demonstrate the first speed tip using

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,850
the problem 10.33 85 / 29 it'll start

21
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,070
like any other problem we are provided a

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,100
slash 29 which puts us in this column

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,079
the column provides a subnet row of 248

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,489
and a group size of 8 which gives us our

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,739
subnet mask and total number of

26
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,328
addresses solving for these two

27
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:58,828
attributes cannot be made any quicker as

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,170
they are simply reading numbers from the

29
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,759
cheat sheet we were provided a group

30
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,280
size of 8 which means we would start at

31
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:10,408
0 and increment by 8 until we pass our

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,799
target IP of 285 dot 0 dot 8.16 dot 20

33
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,810
4.30 2.40 we could continue but it would

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,110
take a long time to get to 85 which

35
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,879
brings us to our first speed tip to save

36
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,519
time the group size can be multiplied by

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,530
a 10 we don't have to start at dot 0 if

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,228
we're incrementing by sets of 8 we know

39
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,239
at some point we will land on 80 we can

40
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:32,789
save time by simply starting there then

41
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,310
continue to increment by 8 once we've

42
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,430
hit 88 we've passed our target IP of dot

43
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,379
85 and we can stop from here the process

44
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,509
continues as normal the numbers before

45
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,359
and after our target IP are our network

46
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,180
ID and next network the next network

47
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,890
minus 1 is the broadcast IP our first

48
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,509
and last hosts are the numbers after the

49
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,180
network ID and before the broadcast IP

50
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,590
and just like that we've solved for all

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,710
7a treats let's backtrack a bit and

52
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,079
imagine our problem was 10 not 303 170 /

53
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,359
29 the group size a mass didn't change

54
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,798
so those answers are still accurate but

55
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,330
we are now in a new sub network and

56
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,909
therefore have different answers for the

57
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,790
remaining attributes we were able to use

58
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,169
speed tip number one to jump to 80

59
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:17,658
and then we continued incrementing by

60
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,968
eight but as you can see to get to dot

61
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:20,598
170 even starting at 80 would take a

62
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:22,370
long time

63
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,919
so there's a second part to speed tip

64
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,109
number one we can multiply the group

65
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,059
size by ten then we can double or triple

66
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:31,760
as necessary to get us closer to our

67
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,370
target IP which means from 80 I can go

68
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,489
directly to dot 160 then continue

69
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,289
incrementing by 8 2 dot 168 then dot 176

70
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,780
and at that point we passed our target

71
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:43,519
IP from here we just fill in all the

72
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,139
attributes adding or subtracting 1 as

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,658
necessary just like we've done many

74
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:49,400
times before

75
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:50,989
so speed tip number 1 is that the group

76
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,789
size can be multiplied by 10 then

77
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,230
doubled or tripled as necessary so you

78
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:56,120
can start your increments as close to

79
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:57,979
the target at P as possible remember

80
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,628
once you've doubled or tripled you must

81
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:03,408
continue to increment by the group size

82
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:04,938
until you pass the target IP to

83
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:08,239
demonstrate the second speed tip we will

84
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:11,269
solve the seven attributes for 10.33 147

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,609
/ 28 it'll start like any other problem

86
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:15,438
the provided cider of slash 28 puts us

87
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:17,329
in this column which gives us a subnet

88
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:20,209
mask of 240 and a total number of

89
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,250
addresses of 16 normally we would start

90
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,829
a dot 0 and continue incrementing by 16

91
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,500
until we pass 147 but as you can tell

92
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,120
this could take a long time we could try

93
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,189
to use speed tip number one which has us

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,449
multiply the group size by 10 but that

95
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,180
puts us too far since we've already

96
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:37,939
passed the target IP which brings us to

97
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,439
speed tip number two regardless of what

98
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,969
you are using as your increment every

99
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,000
group size will at some point or another

100
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:46,219
land on dot 128 which means if I'm

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,289
solving for a target IP above 128 I

102
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:50,299
don't need to start a dot 0 I can simply

103
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:51,918
start at dot 128 and continue

104
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,290
incrementing by my group size from here

105
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,049
our group size was 16 so we would

106
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:58,848
continue with dot 124 then dot 160 and

107
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,188
at this point we've passed our target IP

108
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:03,530
from here everything continues as we've

109
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:05,358
done before the number is on either side

110
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,400
of where our target IP would be our the

111
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,049
network ID in the next network VIP

112
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,269
before the next network is the broadcast

113
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,889
and the first and last hosts are the IPS

114
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,548
before and after the network ID and

115
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,930
broadcast SP tip number 2 reveals that

116
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:22,339
every increment will at some point or

117
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:26,478
another land on dot 128 our third

118
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:27,269
problem is 10.33 197 / 30 this IP and

119
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,728
mask will

120
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:31,649
speed tip number three for us just like

121
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,810
any other problem The Cider notation

122
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:35,579
will determine our column and our column

123
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,680
will reveal the subnet mask and total

124
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,269
number of addresses normally we would

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,300
start at zero and increment by four

126
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:44,430
until we pass 197 but obviously that

127
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,780
would take a very long time we could use

128
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,910
speed tip number one which has this

129
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,918
multiplier our group size o 4 by 10

130
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,960
allowing us to start at 40 then

131
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,948
continued by doubling and tripling but

132
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,049
even that would take longer than

133
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,509
necessary we could try speed tip number

134
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,310
2 and started at 128 but incrementing by

135
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,860
sets of 4 from there would still take a

136
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,889
very long time to get to 197 which

137
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,419
brings us to our next speed tip speed

138
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,189
tip number three is that every group

139
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,799
size increment will eventually land on

140
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:12,990
its own subnet mask value or every

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,819
subnet mask value to the left which

142
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,990
means our incremental four will at some

143
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,348
point land on 252 or 248 or 240 and so

144
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,629
on

145
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:23,969
all we then have to do is to find the

146
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:27,719
closest value to our target IP which for

147
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,580
us is 192 so you'll start at dot 192 and

148
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,759
continue incrementing by our group size

149
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,709
0 4 to get us to dot 196 then dot 200

150
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,189
and here we have passed our group size

151
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:39,930
of 197 at this point we've done the hard

152
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:41,279
part and we can now fill in all the

153
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,759
remaining values the same way we always

154
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,968
have

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,370
dot 196 and dot 200 are our network ID

156
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:50,519
and next network dot 199 is the

157
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:53,879
broadcast IP and dot 197 and dot 198 are

158
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,740
our first and last hosts IP this is

159
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,269
probably my favorite speed tip it can

160
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,740
save you a lot of time to jump straight

161
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:02,689
to the subnet value in your cheat sheet

162
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,689
: or any column to the left

163
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:07,750
which brings us to our final speed tip

164
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:09,279
and problem has any other problem the

165
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,110
saito reveals the column and the column

166
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,508
reveals the subnet mask and number of IP

167
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,160
addresses again we absolutely could

168
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,930
solve this the normal way by starting at

169
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,610
dot zero and incrementing by the group

170
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,978
size of eight until we pass the target

171
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,800
IP of dot 117 but that would of course

172
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:25,599
take up additional time we could try

173
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,120
speed tip number one and multiply the

174
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,949
group size by ten and then double it but

175
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,509
we have to be careful here it may appear

176
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,430
like we successfully passed the target

177
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,250
at P but if we tried to continue from

178
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,720
here you would get incorrect attributes

179
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,668
the increment we use to actually pass

180
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,250
the target at P must be by the group

181
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:44,049
size our group size was eight but this

182
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,848
particular increment was a jump of 80 IP

183
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,579
addresses so going to a dot one sixty

184
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:50,918
takes us too far we could have

185
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,359
incremented by eight from 80 and while

186
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,299
that would work it would also take a

187
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,520
long time speed tip number two and three

188
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,259
would allow us to start at dot 128 but

189
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,709
that is already higher than dot 117

190
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,330
which brings us to speed tip number four

191
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:06,489
our final speed tip is that you can

192
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:09,759
start higher than subtract by the group

193
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,098
size if we know we will land on dot 128

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,009
we can start there then decrement by the

195
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,719
group size giving us dot 120 we can

196
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,759
continue to do that until we pass the

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,430
target IP the next decrement would be

198
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,959
dot 112 and here we found the block of

199
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,629
eight IP addresses which include our

200
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,129
target IP once we found the block we can

201
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,379
solve everything else just like normal

202
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:31,329
the number lower than our target IP is

203
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,430
the network ID the number higher than

204
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:35,769
our target IP is the next network the IP

205
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,538
before that one is the broadcast IP the

206
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,579
numbers immediately before and after the

207
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:43,120
network ID and broadcast are our first

208
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:44,348
and last hosts our last speed tip is

209
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,149
that you can start higher than the

210
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:47,860
target IP and decrement by the group

211
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,959
size until you find the specific group

212
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,080
size increment that contains your target

213
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,079
IP

214
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:56,310
in this video we solved for all seven

215
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,709
attributes of subnetting for five more

216
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,060

problems lightning-quick with these

219
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,000
speed tips and a little practice you can

for the 7 attributes faster before

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,170
watching this video you must have

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,368
already watched at least video 1 to

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,320
describe what each of the seven

11
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:23,850
attributes are and video 3 to understand

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,339
the 7 steps to solve for each attribute

13
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,990
I also highly recommend to have watch

14
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,000
video 2 to understand how to draw the

15
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:32,759
cheat sheet and video 4 to get more

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,140
practice using the cheat sheet with that

17
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,719
said let's show you four tips to

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,219
increase your subtending speed we will

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,629
demonstrate the first speed tip using

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,850
the problem 10.33 85 / 29 it'll start

21
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,070
like any other problem we are provided a

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,100
slash 29 which puts us in this column

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,079
the column provides a subnet row of 248

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,489
and a group size of 8 which gives us our

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,739
subnet mask and total number of

26
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,328
addresses solving for these two

27
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:58,828
attributes cannot be made any quicker as

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,170
they are simply reading numbers from the

29
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,759
cheat sheet we were provided a group

30
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,280
size of 8 which means we would start at

31
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:10,408
0 and increment by 8 until we pass our

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,799
target IP of 285 dot 0 dot 8.16 dot 20

33
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,810
4.30 2.40 we could continue but it would

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,110
take a long time to get to 85 which

35
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,879
brings us to our first speed tip to save

36
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,519
time the group size can be multiplied by

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,530
a 10 we don't have to start at dot 0 if

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,228
we're incrementing by sets of 8 we know

39
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,239
at some point we will land on 80 we can

40
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:32,789
save time by simply starting there then

41
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,310
continue to increment by 8 once we've

42
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,430
hit 88 we've passed our target IP of dot

43
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,379
85 and we can stop from here the process

44
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,509
continues as normal the numbers before

45
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,359
and after our target IP are our network

46
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,180
ID and next network the next network

47
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,890
minus 1 is the broadcast IP our first

48
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,509
and last hosts are the numbers after the

49
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,180
network ID and before the broadcast IP

50
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,590
and just like that we've solved for all

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,710
7a treats let's backtrack a bit and

52
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,079
imagine our problem was 10 not 303 170 /

53
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,359
29 the group size a mass didn't change

54
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,798
so those answers are still accurate but

55
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,330
we are now in a new sub network and

56
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,909
therefore have different answers for the

57
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,790
remaining attributes we were able to use

58
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,169
speed tip number one to jump to 80

59
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:17,658
and then we continued incrementing by

60
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,968
eight but as you can see to get to dot

61
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:20,598
170 even starting at 80 would take a

62
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:22,370
long time

63
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,919
so there's a second part to speed tip

64
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,109
number one we can multiply the group

65
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,059
size by ten then we can double or triple

66
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:31,760
as necessary to get us closer to our

67
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,370
target IP which means from 80 I can go

68
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,489
directly to dot 160 then continue

69
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,289
incrementing by 8 2 dot 168 then dot 176

70
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,780
and at that point we passed our target

71
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:43,519
IP from here we just fill in all the

72
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,139
attributes adding or subtracting 1 as

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,658
necessary just like we've done many

74
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:49,400
times before

75
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:50,989
so speed tip number 1 is that the group

76
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,789
size can be multiplied by 10 then

77
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,230
doubled or tripled as necessary so you

78
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:56,120
can start your increments as close to

79
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:57,979
the target at P as possible remember

80
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,628
once you've doubled or tripled you must

81
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:03,408
continue to increment by the group size

82
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:04,938
until you pass the target IP to

83
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:08,239
demonstrate the second speed tip we will

84
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:11,269
solve the seven attributes for 10.33 147

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,609
/ 28 it'll start like any other problem

86
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:15,438
the provided cider of slash 28 puts us

87
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:17,329
in this column which gives us a subnet

88
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:20,209
mask of 240 and a total number of

89
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,250
addresses of 16 normally we would start

90
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,829
a dot 0 and continue incrementing by 16

91
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,500
until we pass 147 but as you can tell

92
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,120
this could take a long time we could try

93
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,189
to use speed tip number one which has us

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,449
multiply the group size by 10 but that

95
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,180
puts us too far since we've already

96
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:37,939
passed the target IP which brings us to

97
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,439
speed tip number two regardless of what

98
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,969
you are using as your increment every

99
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,000
group size will at some point or another

100
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:46,219
land on dot 128 which means if I'm

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,289
solving for a target IP above 128 I

102
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:50,299
don't need to start a dot 0 I can simply

103
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:51,918
start at dot 128 and continue

104
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,290
incrementing by my group size from here

105
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,049
our group size was 16 so we would

106
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:58,848
continue with dot 124 then dot 160 and

107
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,188
at this point we've passed our target IP

108
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:03,530
from here everything continues as we've

109
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:05,358
done before the number is on either side

110
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,400
of where our target IP would be our the

111
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,049
network ID in the next network VIP

112
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,269
before the next network is the broadcast

113
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,889
and the first and last hosts are the IPS

114
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,548
before and after the network ID and

115
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,930
broadcast SP tip number 2 reveals that

116
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:22,339
every increment will at some point or

117
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:26,478
another land on dot 128 our third

118
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:27,269
problem is 10.33 197 / 30 this IP and

119
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,728
mask will

120
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:31,649
speed tip number three for us just like

121
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,810
any other problem The Cider notation

122
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:35,579
will determine our column and our column

123
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,680
will reveal the subnet mask and total

124
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,269
number of addresses normally we would

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,300
start at zero and increment by four

126
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:44,430
until we pass 197 but obviously that

127
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,780
would take a very long time we could use

128
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,910
speed tip number one which has this

129
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,918
multiplier our group size o 4 by 10

130
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,960
allowing us to start at 40 then

131
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,948
continued by doubling and tripling but

132
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,049
even that would take longer than

133
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,509
necessary we could try speed tip number

134
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,310
2 and started at 128 but incrementing by

135
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,860
sets of 4 from there would still take a

136
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,889
very long time to get to 197 which

137
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,419
brings us to our next speed tip speed

138
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,189
tip number three is that every group

139
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,799
size increment will eventually land on

140
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:12,990
its own subnet mask value or every

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,819
subnet mask value to the left which

142
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,990
means our incremental four will at some

143
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,348
point land on 252 or 248 or 240 and so

144
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,629
on

145
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:23,969
all we then have to do is to find the

146
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:27,719
closest value to our target IP which for

147
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,580
us is 192 so you'll start at dot 192 and

148
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,759
continue incrementing by our group size

149
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,709
0 4 to get us to dot 196 then dot 200

150
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,189
and here we have passed our group size

151
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:39,930
of 197 at this point we've done the hard

152
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:41,279
part and we can now fill in all the

153
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,759
remaining values the same way we always

154
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,968
have

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,370
dot 196 and dot 200 are our network ID

156
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:50,519
and next network dot 199 is the

157
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:53,879
broadcast IP and dot 197 and dot 198 are

158
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,740
our first and last hosts IP this is

159
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,269
probably my favorite speed tip it can

160
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,740
save you a lot of time to jump straight

161
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:02,689
to the subnet value in your cheat sheet

162
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,689
: or any column to the left

163
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:07,750
which brings us to our final speed tip

164
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:09,279
and problem has any other problem the

165
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,110
saito reveals the column and the column

166
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,508
reveals the subnet mask and number of IP

167
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,160
addresses again we absolutely could

168
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,930
solve this the normal way by starting at

169
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,610
dot zero and incrementing by the group

170
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,978
size of eight until we pass the target

171
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,800
IP of dot 117 but that would of course

172
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:25,599
take up additional time we could try

173
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,120
speed tip number one and multiply the

174
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,949
group size by ten and then double it but

175
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,509
we have to be careful here it may appear

176
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,430
like we successfully passed the target

177
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,250
at P but if we tried to continue from

178
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,720
here you would get incorrect attributes

179
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,668
the increment we use to actually pass

180
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,250
the target at P must be by the group

181
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:44,049
size our group size was eight but this

182
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,848
particular increment was a jump of 80 IP

183
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,579
addresses so going to a dot one sixty

184
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:50,918
takes us too far we could have

185
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,359
incremented by eight from 80 and while

186
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,299
that would work it would also take a

187
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,520
long time speed tip number two and three

188
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,259
would allow us to start at dot 128 but

189
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,709
that is already higher than dot 117

190
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,330
which brings us to speed tip number four

191
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:06,489
our final speed tip is that you can

192
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:09,759
start higher than subtract by the group

193
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,098
size if we know we will land on dot 128

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,009
we can start there then decrement by the

195
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,719
group size giving us dot 120 we can

196
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,759
continue to do that until we pass the

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,430
target IP the next decrement would be

198
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,959
dot 112 and here we found the block of

199
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,629
eight IP addresses which include our

200
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,129
target IP once we found the block we can

201
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,379
solve everything else just like normal

202
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:31,329
the number lower than our target IP is

203
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,430
the network ID the number higher than

204
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:35,769
our target IP is the next network the IP

205
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,538
before that one is the broadcast IP the

206
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,579
numbers immediately before and after the

207
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:43,120
network ID and broadcast are our first

208
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:44,348
and last hosts our last speed tip is

209
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,149
that you can start higher than the

210
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:47,860
target IP and decrement by the group

211
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,959
size until you find the specific group

212
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,080
size increment that contains your target

213
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,079
IP

214
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:56,310
in this video we solved for all seven

215
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,709
attributes of subnetting for five more

216
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,060
problems we did this using for speed

217
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,339
tips that will help you solve submarine

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,259
problems lightning-quick with these

219
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,000
speed tips and a little practice you can

220
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,650
easily get to solving sub many problems

221
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,079
well within the 60 seconds this video

222
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:12,579
series projects possibly even as fast as

223
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:27,360
10 seconds or less

[Music]

225
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,419
you

1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,639
hey YouTube welcome to the ipv4

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,740
subnetting mastery video series welcome

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,359
to video 6 in this video we will show

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,949
you how to apply the method learn in

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,308
previous videos to submitting problems

6
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,629
in the third octet this is the

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,759
submitting cheat sheet we've been using

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,289
for the first 5 videos to learn more

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,779
about how to draw the first three rows

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,310
check out video to the last step to

11
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,198
drawing this cheat sheet was to list out

12
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:28,018
all Sutter notations from slash 32

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,939
through slash 25 to extend the cheat

14
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,549
sheet to include a third octet all you

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,200
have to do is continue where we left off

16
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,710
we ended on a slash 25 so you'll

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,239
continue with a slash 24 on the next row

18
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,799
with this extension we can use the cheat

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,628
sheet to solve sub banging problems in

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,750
the third octet we will show you how

21
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,159
with three example problems the process

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,840
for solving submitting problems in the

23
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,878
third octet is largely the same as what

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,260
we've been doing notice the seven steps

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,659
we've used in Prior videos remains

26
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,250
mostly unchanged the one exception is

27
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,648
solving for the number of IPs we will

28
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,269
show you how that works shortly our

29
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,320
first example problem will be ten dot

30
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,728
4.77 dot 188 slash 19 just like before

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,199
we will start by using the setter

32
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,810
notation to find our column in the

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,270
cheechee we were given a slash 19 which

34
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,799
puts us in this column next we will

35
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,899
convert between subnet mask and cider

36
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,540
notation the subnet row in our column

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,490
provides us with a value of 224 but

38
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,380
remember we are now in the third octet

39
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,478
which means we will still use the value

40
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,569
of 224 but it now appears in the third

41
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,890
octet a slash nineteen insider notation

42
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:39,739
equates to the subnet mask of

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:42,269
255.255.255.0 is b0

44
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:44,728
next we will locate the group size which

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,859
for us is 32 and we will increment by

46
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,780
this value in the relevant column but

47
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,969
since a slash 19 is in the third octet

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,040
the third octet is our relevant column

49
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:55,798
this is the column we will use for our

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,070
increment starting from 0 in sets of 32

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,579
until we passed the target of 77 so

52
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:04,408
you'll have dot 0 dot 32 dot 60 4.96 and

53
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,559
at this point we've passed our target of

54
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,689
77 and we can stop this completes all

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,550
the values in the third octet we can

56
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,930
fill in the remaining octet by bringing

57
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,730
down the values from our target

58
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,129
for the first two octets and using dot

59
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:19,679
zero for the fourth octet and with that

60
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:21,120
we've completed the hard part from this

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,010
point the process is identical to what

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,049
we've done before the IP addresses

63
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,509
before and after our target IP are our

64
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:29,159
network ID and next network the IP

65
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,468
addresses before our next network is the

66
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:35,009
broadcast IP since our next network was

67
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:39,120
10.49 t 6.0 our broadcast IP would be 10

68
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:41,158
dot 4.95 dot 255 happy address after our

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,780
network ID is the first host and the IP

70
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:45,719
address before our broadcast IP is the

71
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,789
last host and finally we get to the

72
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,378
number of addresses the easiest way to

73
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:51,090
solve for the number of addresses is to

74
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,608
use what is sometimes called 2 to the

75
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,378
end notation the way it works is to take

76
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,930
your setter notation and subtract it

77
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:00,388
from 32 then raise 2 to the power of

78
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,689
that value for us we were given a slash

79
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:06,299
19 so he would take 32 minus 19 which

80
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:09,269
gets us 13 then take 2 and raise it to

81
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:12,959
the power of 13 this gives us a total

82
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,849
number of addresses of 8,192 keep in

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,319
mind on a certification exam it'd be

84
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:18,149
rare to be asked to calculate the number

85
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,179
of IP addresses for a sub network this

86
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,620
large without a calculator and just like

87
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,540
that we've completed the process to

88
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,069
solve for all seven attributes using the

89
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,728
same seven steps and cheat sheet as

90
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:34,408
before our second example problem will

91
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:36,389
be 10.4 235 99 / 21 it'll start the same

92
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:38,400
way as before we'll use the provided

93
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,159
cider notation to find our respective

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,079
column in the cheat sheet our column

95
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,209
provides us a subnet mask value of 248

96
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,949
and since we're in the third octet this

97
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,229
value will appear in the third octet

98
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,629
then we will locate our group size which

99
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,840
is 8 and increment in the third octet in

100
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:59,668
sets of 8 starting from 0 so we would

101
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,959
have 0 dot 8.16 24 dot 32 and we could

102
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,389
continue but it would take us a long

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,889
time to get to 235 but remember all

104
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,319
those speed tips we learned in video 5

105
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,989
we don't actually need to start at dot 0

106
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,698
we can just start a dot 224 and continue

107
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,299
incrementing in sets of 8 from here

108
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,549
giving us dot 2 32.2 40 and at this

109
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,280
point we've passed our target IP of 235

110
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,929
and we can stop we could complete the

111
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,429
remaining columns and from here we can

112
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,269
simply fill in the attributes as we've

113
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,269
done many times before

114
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,150
to solve the total number of addresses

115
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:37,839
we would take 32 and subtract our Sider

116
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:40,568
notation of 21 giving us 11 then take 2

117
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,989
raised to the power of 11 to get us 2048

118
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:46,210
and that takes care of our second

119
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,650
example problem we have one left in this

120
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:55,418
video our final example problem will be

121
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:56,888
10 dot 4 dot 2 11.66 / 18 as before The

122
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:58,478
Cider will give us our column the cheat

123
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,689
sheet and our column will give us the

124
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:04,870
subnet mask the group size for a / 18 is

125
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:07,990
64 and we'll increment by 64 starting

126
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:13,959
from 0 in the third octet this gives us

127
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:16,088
dot 64 128 dot 192 dot 256 weight 2 and

128
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,628
a 56 is not a valid value in an IP

129
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:21,550
address we encountered this in video 4

130
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:25,088
instead we need to set that octet 2.0

131
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:29,740
and commence the next octet by 1 taking

132
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:32,528
us from 10.4 192 dot 0 to 10 dot v dot 0

133
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,180
dot 0 at which point we've passed our

134
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:36,728
target IP and can start filling in

135
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,588
values just like before the process from

136
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:40,568
here continues exactly as it has in the

137
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,098
past subtracting an adding one and has

138
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,649
appropriate to identify the seven

139
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:46,449
attributes of subnetting for the number

140
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:49,810
of IP addresses we were given a cider of

141
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:52,330
18 so you would take 32 minus 18 to give

142
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:58,269
us 14 and 2 raised to the power of 14

143
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:59,978
gives us 16384 IP addresses we've just

144
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:01,628
completed three example problems that

145
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:03,848
required subletting in the third octet

146
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,009
that last problem despite the

147
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:08,500
explanations still only took us about 60

148
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,939
seconds hopefully by now you can see how

149
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,829
the process for submitting in the third

150
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,199
octet is largely the same as it was for

151
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,639
the fourth octet in the next video we'll

152
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,500
extend the process to the first and

153
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:30,759
second octet

154
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:30,759
[Music]

1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,639
hey YouTube welcome to the ipv4

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,740
subnetting mastery video series welcome

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,359
to video 6 in this video we will show

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,949
you how to apply the method learn in

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,308
previous videos to submitting problems

6
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,629
in the third octet this is the

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,759
submitting cheat sheet we've been using

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,289
for the first 5 videos to learn more

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,779
about how to draw the first three rows

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,310
check out video to the last step to

11
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,198
drawing this cheat sheet was to list out

12
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:28,018
all Sutter notations from slash 32

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,939
through slash 25 to extend the cheat

14
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,549
sheet to include a third octet all you

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,200
have to do is continue where we left off

16
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,710
we ended on a slash 25 so you'll

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,239
continue with a slash 24 on the next row

18
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,799
with this extension we can use the cheat

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,628
sheet to solve sub banging problems in

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,750
the third octet we will show you how

21
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,159
with three example problems the process

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,840
for solving submitting problems in the

23
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,878
third octet is largely the same as what

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,260
we've been doing notice the seven steps

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,659
we've used in Prior videos remains

26
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,250
mostly unchanged the one exception is

27
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,648
solving for the number of IPs we will

28
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,269
show you how that works shortly our

29
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,320
first example problem will be ten dot

30
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,728
4.77 dot 188 slash 19 just like before

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,199
we will start by using the setter

32
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,810
notation to find our column in the

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,270
cheechee we were given a slash 19 which

34
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,799
puts us in this column next we will

35
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,899
convert between subnet mask and cider

36
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,540
notation the subnet row in our column

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,490
provides us with a value of 224 but

38
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,380
remember we are now in the third octet

39
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,478
which means we will still use the value

40
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,569
of 224 but it now appears in the third

41
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,890
octet a slash nineteen insider notation

42
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:39,739
equates to the subnet mask of

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:42,269
255.255.255.0 is b0

44
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:44,728
next we will locate the group size which

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,859
for us is 32 and we will increment by

46
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,780
this value in the relevant column but

47
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,969
since a slash 19 is in the third octet

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,040
the third octet is our relevant column

49
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:55,798
this is the column we will use for our

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,070
increment starting from 0 in sets of 32

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,579
until we passed the target of 77 so

52
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:04,408
you'll have dot 0 dot 32 dot 60 4.96 and

53
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,559
at this point we've passed our target of

54
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,689
77 and we can stop this completes all

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,550
the values in the third octet we can

56
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,930
fill in the remaining octet by bringing

57
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,730
down the values from our target

58
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,129
for the first two octets and using dot

59
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:19,679
zero for the fourth octet and with that

60
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:21,120
we've completed the hard part from this

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,010
point the process is identical to what

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,049
we've done before the IP addresses

63
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,509
before and after our target IP are our

64
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:29,159
network ID and next network the IP

65
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,468
addresses before our next network is the

66
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:35,009
broadcast IP since our next network was

67
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:39,120
10.49 t 6.0 our broadcast IP would be 10

68
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:41,158
dot 4.95 dot 255 happy address after our

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,780
network ID is the first host and the IP

70
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:45,719
address before our broadcast IP is the

71
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,789
last host and finally we get to the

72
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,378
number of addresses the easiest way to

73
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:51,090
solve for the number of addresses is to

74
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,608
use what is sometimes called 2 to the

75
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,378
end notation the way it works is to take

76
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,930
your setter notation and subtract it

77
00:02:55,378 --> 00:03:00,388
from 32 then raise 2 to the power of

78
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,689
that value for us we were given a slash

79
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:06,299
19 so he would take 32 minus 19 which

80
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:09,269
gets us 13 then take 2 and raise it to

81
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:12,959
the power of 13 this gives us a total

82
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,849
number of addresses of 8,192 keep in

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,319
mind on a certification exam it'd be

84
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:18,149
rare to be asked to calculate the number

85
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,179
of IP addresses for a sub network this

86
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,620
large without a calculator and just like

87
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,540
that we've completed the process to

88
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,069
solve for all seven attributes using the

89
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,728
same seven steps and cheat sheet as

90
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:34,408
before our second example problem will

91
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:36,389
be 10.4 235 99 / 21 it'll start the same

92
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:38,400
way as before we'll use the provided

93
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,159
cider notation to find our respective

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,079
column in the cheat sheet our column

95
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,209
provides us a subnet mask value of 248

96
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,949
and since we're in the third octet this

97
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,229
value will appear in the third octet

98
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,629
then we will locate our group size which

99
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,840
is 8 and increment in the third octet in

100
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:59,668
sets of 8 starting from 0 so we would

101
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,959
have 0 dot 8.16 24 dot 32 and we could

102
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,389
continue but it would take us a long

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,889
time to get to 235 but remember all

104
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,319
those speed tips we learned in video 5

105
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,989
we don't actually need to start at dot 0

106
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:11,698
we can just start a dot 224 and continue

107
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,299
incrementing in sets of 8 from here

108
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,549
giving us dot 2 32.2 40 and at this

109
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,280
point we've passed our target IP of 235

110
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,929
and we can stop we could complete the

111
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,429
remaining columns and from here we can

112
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,269
simply fill in the attributes as we've

113
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,269
done many times before

114
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,150
to solve the total number of addresses

115
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:37,839
we would take 32 and subtract our Sider

116
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:40,568
notation of 21 giving us 11 then take 2

117
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,989
raised to the power of 11 to get us 2048

118
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:46,210
and that takes care of our second

119
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,650
example problem we have one left in this

120
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:55,418
video our final example problem will be

121
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:56,888
10 dot 4 dot 2 11.66 / 18 as before The

122
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:58,478
Cider will give us our column the cheat

123
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,689
sheet and our column will give us the

124
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:04,870
subnet mask the group size for a / 18 is

125
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:07,990
64 and we'll increment by 64 starting

126
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:13,959
from 0 in the third octet this gives us

127
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:16,088
dot 64 128 dot 192 dot 256 weight 2 and

128
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,628
a 56 is not a valid value in an IP

129
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:21,550
address we encountered this in video 4

130
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:25,088
instead we need to set that octet 2.0

131
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:29,740
and commence the next octet by 1 taking

132
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:32,528
us from 10.4 192 dot 0 to 10 dot v dot 0

133
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,180
dot 0 at which point we've passed our

134
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:36,728
target IP and can start filling in

135
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,588
values just like before the process from

136
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:40,568
here continues exactly as it has in the

137
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,098
past subtracting an adding one and has

138
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,649
appropriate to identify the seven

139
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:46,449
attributes of subnetting for the number

140
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:49,810
of IP addresses we were given a cider of

141
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:52,330
18 so you would take 32 minus 18 to give

142
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:58,269
us 14 and 2 raised to the power of 14

143
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:59,978
gives us 16384 IP addresses we've just

144
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:01,628
completed three example problems that

145
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:03,848
required subletting in the third octet

146
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,009
that last problem despite the

147
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:08,500
explanations still only took us about 60

148
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,939
seconds hopefully by now you can see how

149
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,829
the process for submitting in the third

150
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,199
octet is largely the same as it was for

151
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,639
the fourth octet in the next video we'll

152
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,500
extend the process to the first and

153
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:30,759
second octet

154
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:30,759
[Music]

1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,040
hey YouTube welcome to the ipv4

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,960
subnetting mastery video series welcome

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,550
to video seven in this video we'll show

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,410
you how to solve submitting problems in

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,969
the first and second octet then we will

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,320
wrap up the series by tying everything

7
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,169
back together to what we discussed in

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,399
the first video this is the subletting

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,010
cheat sheet we've been using for the

10
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,448
first six videos in the last video we

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,789
extended the cheat sheet to include the

12
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,529
site or values for the third octet to

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,300
extend to the second and first octet we

14
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:29,399
will simply continue the process we

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,859
ended with / 17 so we will continue with

16
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:36,589
/ 16 through / 9 for the second octet

17
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,590
and / 8 through / 1 for the first octet

18
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:41,640
our first example will be a submitting

19
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,299
prom in the second octet we will solve

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,329
all seven attributes for 10.50 1 11.2 -

21
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,069
2 / 12 if you watch the last video

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,689
you'll understand the process to use

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,759
this cheat sheet for any octet is nearly

24
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:56,280
identical you just have to be mindful of

25
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,108
which octet you are in as always we will

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,179
start by using the provided cider value

27
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,460
of / 12 to find our column in the cheat

28
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,319
sheet then we'll use the column to

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,510
determine the subnet value which is 240

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,579
since the problem we are solving for is

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,400
in the second octet 240 will appear in

32
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,438
the second octet then we will use the

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,240
group size of 16 to increment in the

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,149
relevant column starting from dot 0

35
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:21,390
since a / 12 is in the second octet our

36
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:26,250
mint will also be in the second octet so

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,868
you'll have 0.16 top 32 48 . 64 and at

38
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,078
this point we've passed our target value

39
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,519
of 50 we can bring down the appropriate

40
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,078
values for the remaining octet

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,670
he chalked out to the left of our

42
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,548
increment is inherited from above and

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,290
each octet to the right is 0 and from

44
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,700
here the process to fill in the 7

45
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,420
attributes is the same as we've done

46
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,490
many times before and that is how to use

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,899
the same cheat sheet and steps to solve

48
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:52,769
for submitting problems in the second

49
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,750
octet next we'll do a subheading problem

50
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,780
in the first octet we will solve all

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,978
subheading attributes for 10.50 111 - t

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,718
2 / 7 the process starts the same / 7

53
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,658
gives us our column and the column gives

54
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:09,090
us our subnet mask value of 254 since

55
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,250
the / 7 is in the first octet this value

56
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,080
will appear in the first octet every

57
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,280
octet to the right will be 0

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,110
next we will use the group size of two

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,439
to increment from zero in the first

60
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,930
octet until we pass our target of ten

61
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,750
giving us zero two four six eight ten

62
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,760
twelve we can now fill in the remaining

63
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,530
octets and at this point we've done the

64
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,030
hard part and can simply fill in the

65
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,680
appropriate attributes adding or

66
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:37,180
subtracting one as necessary just like

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,560
that we've solved the subletting problem

68
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,510
in the first octet in less than a minute

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,159
okay we've reached the final prom this

70
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:46,750
one will hopefully tie everything back

71
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,900
together to what you learn back in video

72
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:55,659
1 we will solve all seven attributes for

73
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:57,159
two 1351 11.2 to 2/2 as before

74
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,500
The Cider of slash two gives us our

75
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,329
column in the cheat sheet and the column

76
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,400
gives us the subnet mask value of 192

77
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:06,099
which appears in the first octet since

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,530
this is a slash two will then increment

79
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:10,509
in sets of our group size of 64 in the

80
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:16,829
first octet until we pass our target IP

81
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:19,358
giving us zero 64 128 192 56 the weight

82
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:22,000
206 is not a valid value for an ipv4

83
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:23,859
address we also can't exactly increase

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,620
the next octet because there is no octet

85
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:30,670
before the first so let's talk about

86
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,099
what is happening with this problem this

87
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:37,750
is every IP address in the ipv4 internet

88
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:42,129
starting from 0 0 0 0 through 255 255

89
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:44,469
255 255 this is referred to as a / 0

90
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:47,979
network and includes all 4.2 billion

91
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:49,870
addresses in ipv4 if we were to break up

92
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,969
the entire Internet into two parts we

93
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,430
would have to equal slash 1 and sub

94
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,959
networks if we were to break up each of

95
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,469
those into two parts we would have a

96
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,598
total of 4 equal slash two networks when

97
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:03,549
we were doing our increments of 64 we

98
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,848
were simply listing out the first IP

99
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:08,049
address in each / 2 sub Network a

102
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,439
successfully able to identify at the

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,329
network ID which is the first IP in the

104
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,939
block but you'll notice there is no

105
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,240
slash to block after this is the last

106
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:25,509
slash to in the Internet hence there is

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,530
no next network attribute possible the

108
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:28,120
last IP in the block

109
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:30,159
serves as the broadcast IP address and

110
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,050
the IP addresses after and before the

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,540
network ID and broadcasts are our first

112
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,490
and last hosts to get the total number

113
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,879
of IP addresses we would simply take 32

114
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:42,870
minus 2 which is 30 + 2 ^ 30 gives us

115
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,040
approximately 1 billion addresses and

116
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,829

hey YouTube welcome to the ipv4

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,960
subnetting mastery video series welcome

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,550
to video seven in this video we'll show

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,410
you how to solve submitting problems in

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,969
the first and second octet then we will

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,320
wrap up the series by tying everything

7
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,169
back together to what we discussed in

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,399
the first video this is the subletting

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,010
cheat sheet we've been using for the

10
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,448
first six videos in the last video we

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,789
extended the cheat sheet to include the

12
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,529
site or values for the third octet to

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,300
extend to the second and first octet we

14
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:29,399
will simply continue the process we

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,859
ended with / 17 so we will continue with

16
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:36,589
/ 16 through / 9 for the second octet

17
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,590
and / 8 through / 1 for the first octet

18
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:41,640
our first example will be a submitting

19
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,299
prom in the second octet we will solve

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,329
all seven attributes for 10.50 1 11.2 -

21
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,069
2 / 12 if you watch the last video

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,689
you'll understand the process to use

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,759
this cheat sheet for any octet is nearly

24
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:56,280
identical you just have to be mindful of

25
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,108
which octet you are in as always we will

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,179
start by using the provided cider value

27
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,460
of / 12 to find our column in the cheat

28
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,319
sheet then we'll use the column to

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,510
determine the subnet value which is 240

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,579
since the problem we are solving for is

31
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,400
in the second octet 240 will appear in

32
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,438
the second octet then we will use the

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,240
group size of 16 to increment in the

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,149
relevant column starting from dot 0

35
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:21,390
since a / 12 is in the second octet our

36
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:26,250
mint will also be in the second octet so

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,868
you'll have 0.16 top 32 48 . 64 and at

38
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,078
this point we've passed our target value

39
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,519
of 50 we can bring down the appropriate

40
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,078
values for the remaining octet

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,670
he chalked out to the left of our

42
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,548
increment is inherited from above and

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,290
each octet to the right is 0 and from

44
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,700
here the process to fill in the 7

45
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,420
attributes is the same as we've done

46
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,490
many times before and that is how to use

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,899
the same cheat sheet and steps to solve

48
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:52,769
for submitting problems in the second

49
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,750
octet next we'll do a subheading problem

50
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,780
in the first octet we will solve all

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,978
subheading attributes for 10.50 111 - t

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,718
2 / 7 the process starts the same / 7

53
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,658
gives us our column and the column gives

54
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:09,090
us our subnet mask value of 254 since

55
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,250
the / 7 is in the first octet this value

56
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,080
will appear in the first octet every

57
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,280
octet to the right will be 0

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,110
next we will use the group size of two

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,439
to increment from zero in the first

60
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,930
octet until we pass our target of ten

61
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,750
giving us zero two four six eight ten

62
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,760
twelve we can now fill in the remaining

63
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,530
octets and at this point we've done the

64
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,030
hard part and can simply fill in the

65
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,680
appropriate attributes adding or

66
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:37,180
subtracting one as necessary just like

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,560
that we've solved the subletting problem

68
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,510
in the first octet in less than a minute

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,159
okay we've reached the final prom this

70
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:46,750
one will hopefully tie everything back

71
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,900
together to what you learn back in video

72
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:55,659
1 we will solve all seven attributes for

73
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:57,159
two 1351 11.2 to 2/2 as before

74
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,500
The Cider of slash two gives us our

75
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,329
column in the cheat sheet and the column

76
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,400
gives us the subnet mask value of 192

77
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:06,099
which appears in the first octet since

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,530
this is a slash two will then increment

79
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:10,509
in sets of our group size of 64 in the

80
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:16,829
first octet until we pass our target IP

81
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:19,358
giving us zero 64 128 192 56 the weight

82
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:22,000
206 is not a valid value for an ipv4

83
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:23,859
address we also can't exactly increase

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,620
the next octet because there is no octet

85
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:30,670
before the first so let's talk about

86
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,099
what is happening with this problem this

87
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:37,750
is every IP address in the ipv4 internet

88
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:42,129
starting from 0 0 0 0 through 255 255

89
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:44,469
255 255 this is referred to as a / 0

90
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:47,979
network and includes all 4.2 billion

91
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:49,870
addresses in ipv4 if we were to break up

92
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,969
the entire Internet into two parts we

93
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,430
would have to equal slash 1 and sub

94
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,959
networks if we were to break up each of

95
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,469
those into two parts we would have a

96
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,598
total of 4 equal slash two networks when

97
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:03,549
we were doing our increments of 64 we

98
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,848
were simply listing out the first IP

99
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:08,049
address in each / 2 sub Network a

100
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:10,899
specific IP address we were solving for

101
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,549
exists in the fourth block we were

102
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,439

103
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,329

slash to in the Internet hence there is

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,530
no next network attribute possible the

hey youtube welcome to the subnetting

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,620
mastery video series there were many

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,589
many requests to extend this series to

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,349
cover vlsm and ethyl ism so we've added

5
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,809
two videos to discuss these topics this

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:20,698
is part one of a two-part appendix to

this series this blue box represents

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,820
every IP address in the ipv4 internet it

9
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,198
is referred to as a slash zero network

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,939
if you watch the subheading mastery

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,609
video series then you know you can break

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,259
up this last zero into two halves each

13
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,929
half is referred to as a slash one

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,519
network there is a rule in networking

15
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:39,960
that states that every site or increment

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,420
doubles the amount of networks you have

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,640
we started with one slash zero network

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,640
and ended with two equal-sized slash one

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,439
network we could continue and break up

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,070
each of our slash ones into two equal

21
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,378
size / 2 giving us a total of 4 equals /

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,770
2 networks inside our original / 0

23
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:01,948
network we could continue 2/3 to get

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:06,799
eight equal / 3 networks or 16 / bored

25
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:06,798
networks or 32 / 5 networks and so on

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,100
the key here is that this is true no

27
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,680
matter where you start

28
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,319
we started with / 0 but if we had

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,470
instead started with a / 10 you would

30
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:23,368
have 2 / 11 networks or 4 / 12 networks

31
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:26,400
or 8 / 13 and so on if we had started

32
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:29,790
with a / 22 you would have to / 23

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,310
networks or 4/24 networks or 8/25

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,640
networks and so on if you have started

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:41,310
with / 18 you would have 2 / 9 teens or

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,079
4 / 20s or 16/20 2's and so on either

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,640
way every time you increase your cider

38
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,779
you double the number of networks you

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,790
have this network doubling effect can be

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,790
used to easily solve two types of

41
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,520
subnetting questions here are those

42
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,649
types of questions the first type of

43
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,170
question looks something like this if

44
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,299
you start with a / 18 what size sub

45
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,609
network would you need to create 100 sub

46
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,909
networks the question provides a

47
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:10,679
starting point of 1/18 and if we apply

48
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,689
it to logic we just learn then going to

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,390
a / 19 would double the amount of

50
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:17,419
networks

51
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:20,529
if we continue 2/20 you would have 4/20

52
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:23,208
networks inside our /a team

53
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,068
the question asks us to solve for 100

54
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,719
sub networks so we just have to continue

55
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:28,849
this process until we reach a network

56
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,270
size that would give us 100 or more sub

57
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,879
networks if we continue to slash 21 we

58
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:38,000
would have 8 / 21 networks still not

59
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:42,049
enough so we continue to 16/20 2

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,689
networks or 32 / 23 networks or 64 / 24

61
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,230
networks until we finally arrive to / 25

62
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:51,560
and we determine there are 128 / 25

63
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:54,379
networks inside a / 18 which gives us

64
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,900
our answer if we wanted 100 sub networks

65
00:02:54,379 --> 00:03:02,120
and we started with a / 18 we would need

66
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,860
to submit the / 18 in 2/25 networks but

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,280
here's the key the same pattern would

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,440
work

69
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,689
regardless of where we start we started

70
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,239
with a / 18 but if we had started with a

71
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,159
/ 10 and we still wanted 100 sub

72
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,349
networks we would again start by writing

73
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,879
our / 10 and then incrementing the

74
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,379
Sattar notation while doubling the

75
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,469
amount of networks until we determine

76
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:27,139
that we would have 128 / 17 networks if

77
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:29,030
we had started with a / 22 we would

78
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,839
again have the double the same number of

79
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:36,169
times in this case 7 to reach 100 28/29

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,629
networks if we wanted to break up our /

81
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:42,759
20 to an hour into 100 sub networks we

82
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:44,900
would need a sub network size of / 29

83
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,548
that is the first type of a question

84
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,620
that can easily be answered with this

85
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:52,879
network doubling logic here's the second

86
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,430
the second type of question looks

87
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,709
something like this if you start with a

88
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,840
/ 20 wine network how many sub Network

89
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,479
can you create that would contain 50 IP

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,719
addresses a question gives us a starting

91
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,578
point of / 21 in a condition of 50 IP

92
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,340
addresses which we need to convert into

93
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,989
a sub Network size if you watch the

94
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,299
subheading mastery series then you have

95
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,890
seen this chi chi and you know that the

96
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,269
first row of this cheat sheet indicates

97
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,399
the number of IP addresses in each

98
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,959
network which means the smallest size

99
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,598
network that had contained 50 IP

100
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,620
addresses would be a / 26 network which

101
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,620
gives us our ending point

102
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,560
the question is essentially now asking

103
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,190
us how many slash 26 sub networks exist

104
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,530
in a slash 21 so we simply list out

105
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,930
every cider increment between slash 21

106
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:40,489
and slash 26 then double at each

107
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,829
increment to determine that there would

108
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,269
be 32 / 26 sub networks inside s / 21

109
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:48,889
the question asked us for the number of

110
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:52,099
sub networks which means our answer is

111
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,560
32 just like before

112
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,990
this same strategy can be used no matter

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,300
where you start we were initially asked

114
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,939
about a slash 21 but let's say we were

115
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,889
instead asked about a slash 23 our

116
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,569
condition at 50 IP addresses hasn't

117
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,569
changed so we're still looking for an

118
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:10,819
ending point of slash 26 so we list out

119
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,560
our starting point of slash 23 which can

120
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:16,879
be divided into two slash twenty fours

121
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,519
or 4/25 s or eight slash 26 networks

122
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,469
which is our stopping point question

123
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,149
asked us how many sub networks we would

124
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:28,010
have which means the answer we would

125
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:30,589
provide is eight if we had started with

126
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,209
a slash 20 you would again list out

127
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:34,549
every side or increment between our

128
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:36,079
starting point and our ending point then

129
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,829
double it every position to determine

130
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:43,789
that there are 64 / 26 networks inside a

131
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:48,319
/ 20 Matt has a second type of sub any

132
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,640
question you will encounter so these are

133
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,349
the types of questions that can easily

134
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,779
be answered using the network doubling

135
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,210
logic we discussed let's talk about

136
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:57,439
these questions in more detail notice

137
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,629
that these types of questions are made

138
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,509
up of three parts a starting point and

139
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:03,110
ending point and a condition you're

140
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,370
going to encounter

141
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,560
sudden any questions which give you a

142
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,329
bunch of excessive information things

143
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,220
like such and such companies expanding

144
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:12,289
or splitting up their teams or buying

145
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,590
new IP space or reorganizing their

146
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,879
current IP space and so on your job will

147
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,759
be to extract from all that useless

148
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,740
information these three parts a starting

149
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,480
point the ending point you are trying to

150
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,670
solve for and the condition they are

151
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,030
giving you to make it easier for you I'm

152
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,830
going to tell you what to look for

153
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:32,869
starting that work size a number of sub

154
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:35,449
networks and the size of each sub

155
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,120
network both questions provided the

156
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,949
starting network size up front question

157
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,100
1 provided the number of sub networks as

158
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,110
a

159
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,930
condition what question - asks us to

160
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,460
solve for the number of sub networks

161
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,139
question one asks us to solve for the

162
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:50,620
size of each sub Network what question -

163
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:53,209
provided the size as a condition

164
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,920
generally you'll be given two out of

165
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,329
these three pieces of information and

166
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,050
you'll be tasked with solving for the

167
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:02,479
third there is something else I want to

168
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,340
point out about these questions notice

169
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,340
both these questions result a bunch of

170
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:09,199
sub networks which are all the same size

171
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:13,549
this is known as fixed length subnet

172
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,009
masks or FL SM in the next video we will

173
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,699
learn about vlsm or a variable length

174
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,800
subnet masking in vlsm each sub network

175
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:25,099
can be different sizes allowing for a

176
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,780
much more efficient use of IP space but

177
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,610
before we do that I want to show you an

178
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:33,469
even faster way to solve for these two

179
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:35,270
types of FL SM questions the fast way to

180
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,240
solve these types of question involves

181
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:40,039
what is known as 2 to the N notation 2

182
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,750
to the N notation uses a powers of 2

183
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,689
table to quickly solve these types of

184
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,259
questions let me show you how it works

185
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,939
let's start with that second question

186
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:52,490
question gives us a starting point of /

187
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,949
20 and a condition of 50 IP addresses

188
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,189
which we deduced correlates to a / 26

189
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:00,079
network if we took / 26 and subtract

190
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,719
that our starting point of / 20 you

191
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,669
would end up with 6 if you look at our

192
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,460
powers of 2 table you'll notice that 2

193
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,350
raised to the sixth power is 64 which is

194
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:13,279
the same answer we arrive to using the

195
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:15,080
network doubling strategy if the

196
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,629
question had instead started us that a /

197
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,729
21 and left our condition at 50 IP

198
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:22,670
addresses we would have taken our ending

199
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,550
sizeof / 26 and subtract it from / 21

200
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,439
giving us 5 and we look at our powers of

201
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,870
two table to see that 2 raised to the

202
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,590
fifth power is 32 which is the correct

203
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:36,379
answer to this question if the question

204
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,180
had started us with a / 22 and we still

205
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,330
have not changed our condition we would

206
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:44,269
again take our ending size of / 26

207
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:47,000
subtract it from / 22 giving us 4 and 2

208
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:50,049
to the fourth power equals 16 which is

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,049
the answer to this question

210
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:56,659
now let's change the condition to a / 30

211
00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:00,889
question is asking us how many / 30

212
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:03,379
networks exist in a / 22 so we will take

213
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:06,319
our ending size / 30 and subtract it

214
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:10,490
from our starting size / 22 giving us 8

215
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,190
+ 2 raised to the 8th power is 256 which

216
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,289
is the correct answer to this question

217
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,440
if the question was how many / 16 are

218
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:21,049
there in a / 10 root again simply do 16

219
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,410
minus 10 to get a 6 then look at 2

220
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:25,639
raised to the 6th power to get us 64

221
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:28,129
which is the correct answer to this

222
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,409
question and that is how you can use the

223
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:33,679
powers of 2 table to quickly solve this

224
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:36,889
type of F LSM question now let's take a

225
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,109
look at the other question this type of

226
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:41,240
question asked us what size subnetwork

227
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,870
would we need to create 100 sub networks

228
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:48,620
starting from a / 18 we started with 1 /

229
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:52,190
18 then broke that into 2 / 19's than 4

230
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:55,159
/ 20s then 8/20 ones but notice those

231
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,900
values - 4 &amp; 8 are the same values in

232
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,049
the answer column of the powers of 2

233
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,639
table we can use this as a shortcut to

234
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:04,759
determine exactly how many times we have

235
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,679
to double the question asked us for 100

236
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,419
sub networks so we just need to look

237
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,370
into this column for the first number

238
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:13,610
that is equal to or higher than 100

239
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,889
which for us is 128 which points us to 2

240
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,230
raised to the seventh that exponent

241
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:21,679
tells us exactly how many Sider values

242
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:25,009
we have to add we started at / 18 and if

243
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,929
we add 7 we end up with / 25 which is

244
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:30,409
the same answer we got when we used the

245
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:33,379
network doubling strategy let's say the

246
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:35,299
question asked us about a / 19 the

247
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:38,210
condition didn't change we still need

248
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:40,519
100 sub networks if we go down this

249
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:43,759
chart the first number greater than or

250
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:48,620
equal to 100 is still 128 which means we

251
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:52,639
need to add 7 / 19 plus 7 equals / 26

252
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:55,460
which is the correct answer if the

253
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,319
questions third us @ / 20 the condition

254
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,629
of 100 sub networks still hasn't changed

255
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,100
so we know we have to increment the same

256
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:08,078
number of times / 20 plus 7 equals / 27

257
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,079
which is the answer we are looking for

258
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,198
let's say the condition changes to 200

259
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,879
sub-networks we look down this chart for

260
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:20,419
the first number that is greater than or

261
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:22,370
equal to 200 which gets us to 56 which

262
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:25,129
tells us that our cider has to increment

263
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:28,940
by 8 a question gave us a starting point

264
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:31,159
of / 20 we add 8 which gets us / 28

265
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:35,029
which would be the correct answer for

266
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:38,000
this question if the question starts us

267
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:40,610
at a / 12 and asked us to solve for 15

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,350
sub networks we again go down this list

269
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,079
until we find the first number greater

270
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,240
than or equal to 15 which for us is 16

271
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:54,769
and that tells us our cider has to

272
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:57,829
increase by 4 / 12 + 4 equals / 16 if

273
00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:00,409
the question starts us at a / 10 nask us

274
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:02,778
to solve for 500 sub networks we will

275
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:04,278
use the same process will again go down

276
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:07,009
this list and look for the first number

277
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:09,799
greater than or equal to 500 which gets

278
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:12,680
us to 512 and that tells us our cider

279
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:16,698
has to increase by 9 we started with /

280
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:20,838
10 plus 9 equals / 19 which is the

281
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:24,799
correct answer to this question if the

282
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,529
question started us at / 15 and ask us

283
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:31,399
for 500 sub networks again we know we

284
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:33,559
have to add 9 and / 15 plus 9 equals /

285
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,528
24 which is the right answer for this

286
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,688
question and that is how you would use

287
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:43,549
the powers of 2 table to quickly solve

288
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:46,458
this type of question so we talk through

289
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:47,929
these two types of FSM questions we

290
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:51,078
first showed you how to solve these

291
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:53,088
using the network doubling logic then we

292
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:55,278
showed you an even faster way using the

293
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:57,230
powers of 2 table it doesn't matter

294
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,028
which strategy you use they both will

295
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,110
get you the correct answers pick the

296
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,828
method that you are most comfortable

297
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,778
with and stick with it

298
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:07,758
that concludes the teaching on FL SM

299
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:10,068

next video where we will explore

309
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,469
variable length subnet mask questions

1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,400
hey youtube welcome to the subnetting

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,620
mastery video series there were many

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,589
many requests to extend this series to

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,349
cover vlsm and ethyl ism so we've added

5
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,809
two videos to discuss these topics this

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:20,698
is part one of a two-part appendix to

7
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:23,489
this series this blue box represents

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,820
every IP address in the ipv4 internet it

9
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,198
is referred to as a slash zero network

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,939
if you watch the subheading mastery

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,609
video series then you know you can break

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,259
up this last zero into two halves each

13
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,929
half is referred to as a slash one

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,519
network there is a rule in networking

15
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:39,960
that states that every site or increment

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,420
doubles the amount of networks you have

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,640
we started with one slash zero network

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,640
and ended with two equal-sized slash one

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,439
network we could continue and break up

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,070
each of our slash ones into two equal

21
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,378
size / 2 giving us a total of 4 equals /

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,770
2 networks inside our original / 0

23
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:01,948
network we could continue 2/3 to get

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:06,799
eight equal / 3 networks or 16 / bored

25
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:06,798
networks or 32 / 5 networks and so on

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,100
the key here is that this is true no

27
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,680
matter where you start

28
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,319
we started with / 0 but if we had

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,470
instead started with a / 10 you would

30
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:23,368
have 2 / 11 networks or 4 / 12 networks

31
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:26,400
or 8 / 13 and so on if we had started

32
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:29,790
with a / 22 you would have to / 23

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,310
networks or 4/24 networks or 8/25

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,640
networks and so on if you have started

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:41,310
with / 18 you would have 2 / 9 teens or

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,079
4 / 20s or 16/20 2's and so on either

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,640
way every time you increase your cider

38
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,779
you double the number of networks you

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,790
have this network doubling effect can be

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,790
used to easily solve two types of

41
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,520
subnetting questions here are those

42
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,649
types of questions the first type of

43
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,170
question looks something like this if

44
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,299
you start with a / 18 what size sub

45
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,609
network would you need to create 100 sub

46
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,909
networks the question provides a

47
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:10,679
starting point of 1/18 and if we apply

48
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,689
it to logic we just learn then going to

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,390
a / 19 would double the amount of

50
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:17,419
networks

51
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:20,529
if we continue 2/20 you would have 4/20

52
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:23,208
networks inside our /a team

53
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,068
the question asks us to solve for 100

54
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,719
sub networks so we just have to continue

55
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:28,849
this process until we reach a network

56
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,270
size that would give us 100 or more sub

57
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,879
networks if we continue to slash 21 we

58
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:38,000
would have 8 / 21 networks still not

59
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:42,049
enough so we continue to 16/20 2

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,689
networks or 32 / 23 networks or 64 / 24

61
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,230
networks until we finally arrive to / 25

62
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:51,560
and we determine there are 128 / 25

63
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:54,379
networks inside a / 18 which gives us

64
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,900
our answer if we wanted 100 sub networks

65
00:02:54,379 --> 00:03:02,120
and we started with a / 18 we would need

66
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,860
to submit the / 18 in 2/25 networks but

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,280
here's the key the same pattern would

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,440
work

69
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,689
regardless of where we start we started

70
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,239
with a / 18 but if we had started with a

71
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,159
/ 10 and we still wanted 100 sub

72
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,349
networks we would again start by writing

73
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,879
our / 10 and then incrementing the

74
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,379
Sattar notation while doubling the

75
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,469
amount of networks until we determine

76
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:27,139
that we would have 128 / 17 networks if

77
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:29,030
we had started with a / 22 we would

78
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,839
again have the double the same number of

79
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:36,169
times in this case 7 to reach 100 28/29

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,629
networks if we wanted to break up our /

81
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:42,759
20 to an hour into 100 sub networks we

82
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:44,900
would need a sub network size of / 29

83
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,548
that is the first type of a question

84
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,620
that can easily be answered with this

85
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:52,879
network doubling logic here's the second

86
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,430
the second type of question looks

87
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,709
something like this if you start with a

88
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,840
/ 20 wine network how many sub Network

89
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,479
can you create that would contain 50 IP

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,719
addresses a question gives us a starting

91
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,578
point of / 21 in a condition of 50 IP

92
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,340
addresses which we need to convert into

93
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,989
a sub Network size if you watch the

94
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,299
subheading mastery series then you have

95
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,890
seen this chi chi and you know that the

96
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,269
first row of this cheat sheet indicates

97
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,399
the number of IP addresses in each

98
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,959
network which means the smallest size

99
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,598
network that had contained 50 IP

100
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,620
addresses would be a / 26 network which

101
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,620
gives us our ending point

102
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,560
the question is essentially now asking

103
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,190
us how many slash 26 sub networks exist

104
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,530
in a slash 21 so we simply list out

105
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,930
every cider increment between slash 21

106
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:40,489
and slash 26 then double at each

107
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,829
increment to determine that there would

108
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,269
be 32 / 26 sub networks inside s / 21

109
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:48,889
the question asked us for the number of

110
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:52,099
sub networks which means our answer is

111
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:54,560
32 just like before

112
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,990
this same strategy can be used no matter

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,300
where you start we were initially asked

114
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,939
about a slash 21 but let's say we were

115
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,889
instead asked about a slash 23 our

116
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,569
condition at 50 IP addresses hasn't

117
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,569
changed so we're still looking for an

118
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:10,819
ending point of slash 26 so we list out

119
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,560
our starting point of slash 23 which can

120
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:16,879
be divided into two slash twenty fours

121
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,519
or 4/25 s or eight slash 26 networks

122
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,469
which is our stopping point question

123
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,149
asked us how many sub networks we would

124
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:28,010
have which means the answer we would

125
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:30,589
provide is eight if we had started with

126
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,209
a slash 20 you would again list out

127
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:34,549
every side or increment between our

128
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:36,079
starting point and our ending point then

129
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,829
double it every position to determine

130
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:43,789
that there are 64 / 26 networks inside a

131
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:48,319
/ 20 Matt has a second type of sub any

132
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,640
question you will encounter so these are

133
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,349
the types of questions that can easily

134
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,779
be answered using the network doubling

135
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,210
logic we discussed let's talk about

136
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:57,439
these questions in more detail notice

137
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,629
that these types of questions are made

138
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,509
up of three parts a starting point and

139
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:03,110
ending point and a condition you're

140
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,370
going to encounter

141
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,560
sudden any questions which give you a

142
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,329
bunch of excessive information things

143
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,220
like such and such companies expanding

144
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:12,289
or splitting up their teams or buying

145
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,590
new IP space or reorganizing their

146
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,879
current IP space and so on your job will

147
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,759
be to extract from all that useless

148
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,740
information these three parts a starting

149
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,480
point the ending point you are trying to

150
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,670
solve for and the condition they are

151
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,030
giving you to make it easier for you I'm

152
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,830
going to tell you what to look for

153
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:32,869
starting that work size a number of sub

154
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:35,449
networks and the size of each sub

155
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,120
network both questions provided the

156
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:39,949
starting network size up front question

157
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,100
1 provided the number of sub networks as

158
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,110
a

159
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,930
condition what question - asks us to

160
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,460
solve for the number of sub networks

161
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,139
question one asks us to solve for the

162
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:50,620
size of each sub Network what question -

163
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:53,209
provided the size as a condition

164
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,920
generally you'll be given two out of

165
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,329
these three pieces of information and

166
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,050
you'll be tasked with solving for the

167
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:02,479
third there is something else I want to

168
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,340
point out about these questions notice

169
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,340
both these questions result a bunch of

170
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:09,199
sub networks which are all the same size

171
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:13,549
this is known as fixed length subnet

172
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,009
masks or FL SM in the next video we will

173
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,699
learn about vlsm or a variable length

174
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,800
subnet masking in vlsm each sub network

175
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:25,099
can be different sizes allowing for a

176
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,780
much more efficient use of IP space but

177
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,610
before we do that I want to show you an

178
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:33,469
even faster way to solve for these two

179
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:35,270
types of FL SM questions the fast way to

180
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,240
solve these types of question involves

181
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:40,039
what is known as 2 to the N notation 2

182
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,750
to the N notation uses a powers of 2

183
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,689
table to quickly solve these types of

184
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,259
questions let me show you how it works

185
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,939
let's start with that second question

186
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:52,490
question gives us a starting point of /

187
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,949
20 and a condition of 50 IP addresses

188
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,189
which we deduced correlates to a / 26

189
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:00,079
network if we took / 26 and subtract

190
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,719
that our starting point of / 20 you

191
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,669
would end up with 6 if you look at our

192
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,460
powers of 2 table you'll notice that 2

193
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,350
raised to the sixth power is 64 which is

194
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:13,279
the same answer we arrive to using the

195
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:15,080
network doubling strategy if the

196
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,629
question had instead started us that a /

197
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,729
21 and left our condition at 50 IP

198
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:22,670
addresses we would have taken our ending

199
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,550
sizeof / 26 and subtract it from / 21

200
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,439
giving us 5 and we look at our powers of

201
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,870
two table to see that 2 raised to the

202
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,590
fifth power is 32 which is the correct

203
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:36,379
answer to this question if the question

204
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,180
had started us with a / 22 and we still

205
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,330
have not changed our condition we would

206
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:44,269
again take our ending size of / 26

207
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:47,000
subtract it from / 22 giving us 4 and 2

208
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:50,049
to the fourth power equals 16 which is

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,049
the answer to this question

210
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:56,659
now let's change the condition to a / 30

211
00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:00,889
question is asking us how many / 30

212
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:03,379
networks exist in a / 22 so we will take

213
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:06,319
our ending size / 30 and subtract it

214
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:10,490
from our starting size / 22 giving us 8

215
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,190
+ 2 raised to the 8th power is 256 which

216
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,289
is the correct answer to this question

217
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,440
if the question was how many / 16 are

218
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:21,049
there in a / 10 root again simply do 16

219
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,410
minus 10 to get a 6 then look at 2

220
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:25,639
raised to the 6th power to get us 64

221
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:28,129
which is the correct answer to this

222
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,409
question and that is how you can use the

223
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:33,679
powers of 2 table to quickly solve this

224
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:36,889
type of F LSM question now let's take a

225
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,109
look at the other question this type of

226
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:41,240
question asked us what size subnetwork

227
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,870
would we need to create 100 sub networks

228
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:48,620
starting from a / 18 we started with 1 /

229
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:52,190
18 then broke that into 2 / 19's than 4

230
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:55,159
/ 20s then 8/20 ones but notice those

231
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,900
values - 4 &amp; 8 are the same values in

232
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,049
the answer column of the powers of 2

233
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,639
table we can use this as a shortcut to

234
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:04,759
determine exactly how many times we have

235
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,679
to double the question asked us for 100

236
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,419
sub networks so we just need to look

237
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,370
into this column for the first number

238
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:13,610
that is equal to or higher than 100

239
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,889
which for us is 128 which points us to 2

240
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,230
raised to the seventh that exponent

241
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:21,679
tells us exactly how many Sider values

242
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:25,009
we have to add we started at / 18 and if

243
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,929
we add 7 we end up with / 25 which is

244
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:30,409
the same answer we got when we used the

245
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:33,379
network doubling strategy let's say the

246
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:35,299
question asked us about a / 19 the

247
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:38,210
condition didn't change we still need

248
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:40,519
100 sub networks if we go down this

249
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:43,759
chart the first number greater than or

250
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:48,620
equal to 100 is still 128 which means we

251
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:52,639
need to add 7 / 19 plus 7 equals / 26

252
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:55,460
which is the correct answer if the

253
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,319
questions third us @ / 20 the condition

254
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,629
of 100 sub networks still hasn't changed

255
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,100
so we know we have to increment the same

256
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:08,078
number of times / 20 plus 7 equals / 27

257
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,079
which is the answer we are looking for

258
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,198
let's say the condition changes to 200

259
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,879
sub-networks we look down this chart for

260
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:20,419
the first number that is greater than or

261
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:22,370
equal to 200 which gets us to 56 which

262
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:25,129
tells us that our cider has to increment

263
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:28,940
by 8 a question gave us a starting point

264
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:31,159
of / 20 we add 8 which gets us / 28

265
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:35,029
which would be the correct answer for

266
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:38,000
this question if the question starts us

267
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:40,610
at a / 12 and asked us to solve for 15

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,350
sub networks we again go down this list

269
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,079
until we find the first number greater

270
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,240
than or equal to 15 which for us is 16

271
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:54,769
and that tells us our cider has to

272
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:57,829
increase by 4 / 12 + 4 equals / 16 if

273
00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:00,409
the question starts us at a / 10 nask us

274
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:02,778
to solve for 500 sub networks we will

275
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:04,278
use the same process will again go down

276
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:07,009
this list and look for the first number

277
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:09,799
greater than or equal to 500 which gets

278
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:12,680
us to 512 and that tells us our cider

279
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:16,698
has to increase by 9 we started with /

280
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:20,838
10 plus 9 equals / 19 which is the

281
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:24,799
correct answer to this question if the

282
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,529
question started us at / 15 and ask us

283
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:31,399
for 500 sub networks again we know we

284
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:33,559
have to add 9 and / 15 plus 9 equals /

285
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,528
24 which is the right answer for this

286
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,688
question and that is how you would use

287
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:43,549
the powers of 2 table to quickly solve

288
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:46,458
this type of question so we talk through

289
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:47,929
these two types of FSM questions we

290
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:51,078
first showed you how to solve these

291
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:53,088
using the network doubling logic then we

292
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:55,278
showed you an even faster way using the

293
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:57,230
powers of 2 table it doesn't matter

294
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,028
which strategy you use they both will

295
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,110
get you the correct answers pick the

296
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,828
method that you are most comfortable

297
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,778
with and stick with it

298
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:07,758
that concludes the teaching on FL SM

299
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:10,068

next video where we will explore

309
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,469
variable length subnet mask questions

1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,160
hey youtube welcome to the subheading

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,960
mastery video series this is part two of

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,160
a two-part appendix which covers FL

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,468
Assam and vlsm

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,109
in part 1 we taught you how to quickly

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,669
and easily solve FL uh some questions in

7
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:18,480
this video will teach you how to do the

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:20,519
same for vlsm questions the best way to

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,560
learn blsm is to visualize the process

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,939
as it is happening in front of you so

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,250
we're gonna work through an example of

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,689
Aeolus on prom for the 9.99 0/24 network

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,090
we're given a slash Mary port block of

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,399
IP addresses which gives us 256 IP

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,440
addresses to delegate we're going to

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,340
assign sub networks from our slash 24

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,808
across these eight segments each of

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,940
these segments will require a certain

19
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,500
amount of IP addresses and it'll be our

20
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,199
job to assign sub networks as

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,969
efficiently as possible

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,949
this is a typical Vila sub problem

23
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,379
you're given a starting network of IP

24
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:56,939
addresses and a bunch of segments that

25
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,479
require a various amount of hosts IP

26
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,339
addresses if you watch the prior video

27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,670
then you know we can break up our slash

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,130
24 network into 2/25 networks this

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,879
splits up at 256 IP addresses in our

30
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:14,819
slash 24 into 2/25 blocks of 128 IP

31
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,158
addresses each we could keep going to

32
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,649
break up our slash 24 into 4 / 26

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,368
networks each containing 64 IP addresses

34
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,430
or 8/27 blocks each containing 32 IP

35
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:29,129
addresses or 16 / 28 blocks each

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,820
containing 16 @p addresses we could go

37
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:34,618
further but we'll stop here for now we

38
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,938
will use this visualization of the IP

39
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,950
address space we have available to

40
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,929
allocate to illustrate variable length

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,770
subnet mask problems and how to solve

42
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,130
them let's start with this network on

43
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,140
top which requires 25 IP addresses what

44
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,289
we need to do is find the small size sub

45
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,269
network that contain 25 IP addresses 16

46
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,509
IP addresses is not enough so we can't

47
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,099
assign a / 28 64 IP addresses is too

48
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,159
many IP addresses so it doesn't make

49
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,109
sense to assign a / 26 the smallest size

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,540
sub network that can contain 25 IP

51
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,750
addresses would be a slash 27 which

52
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,129
gives us 32 total IP addresses which

53
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,110
means one of these blocks of IP

54
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:14,509
addresses will be allocated to our first

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,010
sub Network

56
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,870
if you watch the subheading mastery

57
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:21,299
video series then you are familiar with

58
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,520
this subheading cheat sheet and you know

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,050
that this first row indicates both the

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,909
number of IP addresses in each sub

61
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,210
network as well as the increment between

62
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,280
each network ID for each sub Network

63
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,280
we're assigning a slash 27 which has an

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,169
increment of 32 if we started at dot 0

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,770
and listed every increment for slash

66
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:42,509
twenty seven networks we would get this

67
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,540
what this means is that the first slash

68
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:48,349
twenty seven block has a network ID of

69
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,349
99.9 dot 0

70
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:58,199
has a network ID of 99.9 thirty-two v /

71
00:02:53,909 --> 00:03:00,359
27 has a network ID of 99.9 128 and the

72
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:04,919
seventh slash 27 has a network ID of

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,780
99.9 dot 192 and so on we just need to

74
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,239
pick one of these blocks to assign to

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,699
our sub network for our purposes you'll

76
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,250
simply pick the first block which means

77
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,519
our first segment which requires 25 IP

78
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:23,669
addresses is assign the sub network 99.9

79
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:26,040
0 / 27 for its IP space now let's repeat

80
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,379
the process for this next network this

81
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,780
network requires IP space for 50 hosts

82
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,049
again we need to find the smallest size

83
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,199
network that can contain 50 IP addresses

84
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:39,480
16 is not enough 32 is not enough 64 is

85
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,899
just right which means for this network

86
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,789
we'll have to assign a / 26 our our

87
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,879
cheat sheet tells us that the increment

88
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:50,400
for a / 26 Network is 64 which means our

89
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,799
4 / 26 networks have these network IDs

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,310
we just need to pick one to assign to

91
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,439
our segment now we have to be careful

92
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,420
here it might be tempting to simply grab

93
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,780
the first one but that won't work you

94
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,359
see when we assign the / 27 earlier we

95
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,229
committed the IP address as 99.9 0

96
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,810
through 31 - the first segment this

97
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,699
first part of the first / 26 includes

98
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,270
those IP addresses which are no longer

99
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,509
available

100
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,609
this means we cannot assign the / 26

101
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,159
since a portion of it is already in use

102
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,319
elsewhere in our topology the next

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,910
completely free slash 26 we can assign

104
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,879
would be 999

105
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,250
64 and this is the subnetwork will

106
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:37,449
assign to our segment that requires 50

107
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,699
IP addresses now let's do the same thing

108
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,889
for this third Network which requires 10

109
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,689
IP addresses again we'll find the

110
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,699
smallest size network that has 10 used

111
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:49,300
by P addresses and this points us to a

112
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,819
slash 28 network the increment 4/28

113
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,970
network is 16 which means our slash 28

114
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:56,649
sub networks have these network IDs we

115
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,110
can't use these first two as that FB

116
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:00,669
space is already in use elsewhere we

117
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,090
can't use these four either for the same

118
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,980
reason there are many remaining slash 28

119
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,750
sub networks that we could use for our

120
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,670
purposes we'll simply pick the first

121
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:13,120
available which means our third segment

122
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:18,310
will receive the IP space 99.9 about 32

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,069
slash 28 at this point we've worked

124
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,389
through three segments one at a time now

125
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:23,949
I'd like to show you how to go about

126
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,329
solving vela some prompts more

127
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,659
efficiently by working through these

128
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:30,159
next three segments at the same time

129
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,100
there are two overarching steps you

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,900
should take when solving blsm proms the

131
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,650
first step is start by listing out all

132
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:41,199
sub network sizes you'll need this first

133
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:42,639
segment requires 19 IP addresses and the

134
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,829
smallest size sub network that can

135
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,759
accommodate 19 useful IP addresses is a

136
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:50,829
slash 27 this next segment requires 12

137
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,509
IP addresses and the smallest size sub

138
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:56,560
network that can accommodate 12 usable

139
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:59,289
IP addresses is a slash 28 the next

140
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,910
segment requires 31 IP addresses it

141
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,030
might be tempting to assign this network

142
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:07,150
another slash 27 but be careful a slash

143
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,949
27 has a total of 32 IP addresses but

144
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:11,319
only 30 of those are usable which

145
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:13,779
wouldn't be enough for us therefore to

146
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,909
accommodate 31 hosts we'll have to go to

147
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:21,039
the next size up which would be a slash

148
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,939
26 that takes care of our first step for

149
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,919
blsm Proms

150
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:25,959
which was simply to list out all the

151
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,589
required sub network sizes based upon

152
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,539
the needed amount of IP addresses the

153
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,250
second step for blsm proms is to

154
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,860
actually allocate sub networks to each

155
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,839
segment here's the key though the best

156
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,460
strategy to do this is from largest sub

157
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,189
network to smallest sub network

158
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:45,069
notice earlier we left this slash 28

159
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:46,569
orphan between allocated IP space now

160
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:48,310
this is an intrinsically a terrible

161
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,050
thing but we could avoid this entirely

162
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,240
if we allocated IP addresses from

163
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,770
biggest to smallest so from here on out

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,960
we'll follow that best practice and

165
00:06:53,769 --> 00:07:00,430
start with the biggest network which for

166
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:03,099
us will be this slash 26 the increments

167
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,780
for a slash 26 network is 64 so our

168
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,790
network IDs would have these IP

169
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:10,419
addresses and the first fully available

170
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:15,970
slash 26 network we can allocate is 99.9

171
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:19,210
dot 128 slash 26 the next biggest

172
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,650
network would be our slash 27 the

173
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:23,469
increments for a slash twenty-seven

174
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:26,469
network is 32 so our slash twenty sevens

175
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,360
will have these network IDs the next

176
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,150
fully available slash twenty seventh sub

177
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,600
network would be this one so we allocate

178
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:36,039
99.9 192 slash twenty seven to our

179
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,129
segment which requires a nineteen IP

180
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,080
addresses finally we take care of this

181
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,939
twenty eight the increment four slash

182
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:45,250
twenty eight is 16 which gives us these

183
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:46,959
network IDs and the next available slash

184
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,819
twenty eight network would be this one

185
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:55,479
so we allocate 99.9 two to 4/28 to this

186
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:57,310
last segment notice when we allocated a

187
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,050
piece based from biggest to smallest we

188
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,910
didn't leave any free blocks of IP

189
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,730
addresses stranded between allocated

190
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,250
blocks and that concludes step two of

191
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,259
vlsm proms which was to actually assign

192
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,209
sub networks based upon the sub network

193
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:14,110
sizes we determined we needed from the

194
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:16,569
first step which brings us to these two

195
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,270
segments which each only require two IP

196
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:21,129
addresses given that every router

197
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,959
interface must have an IP address in the

198
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:24,610
networks they are attached to we can

199
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,709
presume that the two IP address is

200
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,840
needed for this top segment are one for

201
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,759
each router interface the same is true

202
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,889
for the bottom Network each router

203
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,600
interface gets one IP address which is

204
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:37,600
where the required two IP addresses for

205
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,340
this network are coming from segments

206
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,899
with only two required IP addresses are

207
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,149
sometimes referred to as point-to-point

208
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,939
networks the only two members of the

209
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,559
segment are the routers themselves the

210
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,870
smallest size sub Network you can get

211
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,589
with two usable IP addresses would be a

212
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,560
slash 30 which is a total of 4

213
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,509
addresses and that is the size of a

214
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:01,679
subnetwork we will assign to each of our

215
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:04,080
point-to-point networks now we need to

216
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,149
carve out slash 30 sub networks our

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,460
visualization only went to slash 28

218
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,559
let's grab one available slash 28 and

219
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,170
use that to carve out smaller sub

220
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,750
networks we can break up that slash 28

221
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:18,299
into 2 slash 29 s with 8 IP addresses

222
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,960
each or four slash 30s with 4 IP

223
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:25,949
addresses each the slash 28 we started

224
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,870
with was 9.99 48 slash 28 which means

225
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,460
that network IDs for these slash 30s

226
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,080
start at dot 48 and each increased by 4

227
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,180
we can pick the first two to use in our

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,050
topology given these two point-to-point

229
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:47,099
segments the address space of 99.9 48

230
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:48,209
slash 30 and 99.9 dot 52 / 30 but

231
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,730
there's something I need to point out

232
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,769
here earlier we said that the smallest

233
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,310
sub network size that has two usable

234
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:59,279
addresses is a slash 30 that was true at

235
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:01,409
one point but an RFC was published which

236
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,199
allows the use of a slash 31 on

237
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:06,000
point-to-point networks the idea there

238
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,890
is if there's only one other note on

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,110
your network you'll never really need a

240
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:13,620
broadcast address so why have one at all

241
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:17,149
a slash 31 has two total IP addresses

242
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,470
and both are usable as host addresses

243
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,059
therefore while what we did is

244
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,070
acceptable for most entry level

245
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,809
certification exams it might not work

246
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,180
for more modern or professional and

247
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,069
senior level certification exams nor

248
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,838
would it work in the real world because

249
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,210
we could save more IP addresses if we

250
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,200
instead assign / 31 networks for a

251
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,200
point-to-point links

252
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,230
so we'll continue to carve out our slash

253
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:44,629
28 + 2 / 31 networks which have an

254
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,029
increment of 2 and we can simply pick

255
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:51,860
the first 2 / 30 ones to assign to our

256
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:54,740
point-to-point links and that my friends

257
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,649
is how to solve blsm questions to

258
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,629
summarize there are two steps the first

259
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,850
step is to determine and list out all

260
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:04,299
sub network sizes based upon the number

261
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,409
of IP addresses you need in each segment

262
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:08,240
remember to always pick the smallest

263
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:10,250
possible sub Network and to account for

264
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,789
usable addresses versus total addresses

265
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,799
in each block the second step is to

266
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:18,259
allocate IP address space from largest

267
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,149
sub Network to smallest making sure not

268
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:24,110
to use the same set of IP addresses for

269
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:27,289
multiple allocations and that concludes

270
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,310
the teaching on blsm questions I hope

271
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,750
you found the extension to the

272
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:32,000
subnetting mastery video series helpful

273
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,110
if you did I'm willing to bet that you

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,970
know someone else that would benefit

275
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,800
from these videos as well please let me

276
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,990
spread the word and share subnet ipv4

277
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,819

00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,160
hey youtube welcome to the subheading

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,960
mastery video series this is part two of

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,160
a two-part appendix which covers FL

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,468
Assam and vlsm

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,109
in part 1 we taught you how to quickly

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,669
and easily solve FL uh some questions in

7
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:18,480
this video will teach you how to do the

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:20,519
same for vlsm questions the best way to

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,560
learn blsm is to visualize the process

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,939
as it is happening in front of you so

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,250
we're gonna work through an example of

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,689
Aeolus on prom for the 9.99 0/24 network

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,090
we're given a slash Mary port block of

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,399
IP addresses which gives us 256 IP

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,440
addresses to delegate we're going to

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,340
assign sub networks from our slash 24

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,808
across these eight segments each of

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,940
these segments will require a certain

19
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,500
amount of IP addresses and it'll be our

20
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,199
job to assign sub networks as

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,969
efficiently as possible

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,949
this is a typical Vila sub problem

23
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,379
you're given a starting network of IP

24
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:56,939
addresses and a bunch of segments that

25
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,479
require a various amount of hosts IP

26
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,339
addresses if you watch the prior video

27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,670
then you know we can break up our slash

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,130
24 network into 2/25 networks this

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,879
splits up at 256 IP addresses in our

30
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:14,819
slash 24 into 2/25 blocks of 128 IP

31
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,158
addresses each we could keep going to

32
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,649
break up our slash 24 into 4 / 26

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,368
networks each containing 64 IP addresses

34
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,430
or 8/27 blocks each containing 32 IP

35
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:29,129
addresses or 16 / 28 blocks each

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,820
containing 16 @p addresses we could go

37
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:34,618
further but we'll stop here for now we

38
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,938
will use this visualization of the IP

39
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,950
address space we have available to

40
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,929
allocate to illustrate variable length

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,770
subnet mask problems and how to solve

42
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,130
them let's start with this network on

43
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,140
top which requires 25 IP addresses what

44
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,289
we need to do is find the small size sub

45
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,269
network that contain 25 IP addresses 16

46
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,509
IP addresses is not enough so we can't

47
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,099
assign a / 28 64 IP addresses is too

48
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,159
many IP addresses so it doesn't make

49
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,109
sense to assign a / 26 the smallest size

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,540
sub network that can contain 25 IP

51
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,750
addresses would be a slash 27 which

52
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,129
gives us 32 total IP addresses which

53
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,110
means one of these blocks of IP

54
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:14,509
addresses will be allocated to our first

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,010
sub Network

56
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,870
if you watch the subheading mastery

57
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:21,299
video series then you are familiar with

58
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,520
this subheading cheat sheet and you know

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,050
that this first row indicates both the

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,909
number of IP addresses in each sub

61
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,210
network as well as the increment between

62
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,280
each network ID for each sub Network

63
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,280
we're assigning a slash 27 which has an

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,169
increment of 32 if we started at dot 0

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,770
and listed every increment for slash

66
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:42,509
twenty seven networks we would get this

67
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,540
what this means is that the first slash

68
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:48,349
twenty seven block has a network ID of

69
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,349
99.9 dot 0

70
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:58,199
has a network ID of 99.9 thirty-two v /

71
00:02:53,909 --> 00:03:00,359
27 has a network ID of 99.9 128 and the

72
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:04,919
seventh slash 27 has a network ID of

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,780
99.9 dot 192 and so on we just need to

74
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,239
pick one of these blocks to assign to

75
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,699
our sub network for our purposes you'll

76
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,250
simply pick the first block which means

77
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,519
our first segment which requires 25 IP

78
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:23,669
addresses is assign the sub network 99.9

79
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:26,040
0 / 27 for its IP space now let's repeat

80
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,379
the process for this next network this

81
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,780
network requires IP space for 50 hosts

82
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,049
again we need to find the smallest size

83
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,199
network that can contain 50 IP addresses

84
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:39,480
16 is not enough 32 is not enough 64 is

85
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,899
just right which means for this network

86
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,789
we'll have to assign a / 26 our our

87
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,879
cheat sheet tells us that the increment

88
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:50,400
for a / 26 Network is 64 which means our

89
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,799
4 / 26 networks have these network IDs

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,310
we just need to pick one to assign to

91
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,439
our segment now we have to be careful

92
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,420
here it might be tempting to simply grab

93
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,780
the first one but that won't work you

94
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,359
see when we assign the / 27 earlier we

95
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,229
committed the IP address as 99.9 0

96
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,810
through 31 - the first segment this

97
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,699
first part of the first / 26 includes

98
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,270
those IP addresses which are no longer

99
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,509
available

100
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,609
this means we cannot assign the / 26

101
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,159
since a portion of it is already in use

102
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,319
elsewhere in our topology the next

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,910
completely free slash 26 we can assign

104
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,879
would be 999

105
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,250
64 and this is the subnetwork will

106
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:37,449
assign to our segment that requires 50

107
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,699
IP addresses now let's do the same thing

108
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,889
for this third Network which requires 10

109
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,689
IP addresses again we'll find the

110
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,699
smallest size network that has 10 used

111
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:49,300
by P addresses and this points us to a

112
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,819
slash 28 network the increment 4/28

113
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,970
network is 16 which means our slash 28

114
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:56,649
sub networks have these network IDs we

115
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,110
can't use these first two as that FB

116
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:00,669
space is already in use elsewhere we

117
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,090
can't use these four either for the same

118
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,980
reason there are many remaining slash 28

119
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,750
sub networks that we could use for our

120
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,670
purposes we'll simply pick the first

121
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:13,120
available which means our third segment

122
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:18,310
will receive the IP space 99.9 about 32

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,069
slash 28 at this point we've worked

124
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,389
through three segments one at a time now

125
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:23,949
I'd like to show you how to go about

126
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,329
solving vela some prompts more

127
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,659
efficiently by working through these

128
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:30,159
next three segments at the same time

129
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,100
there are two overarching steps you

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,900
should take when solving blsm proms the

131
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,650
first step is start by listing out all

132
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:41,199
sub network sizes you'll need this first

133
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:42,639
segment requires 19 IP addresses and the

134
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,829
smallest size sub network that can

135
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,759
accommodate 19 useful IP addresses is a

136
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:50,829
slash 27 this next segment requires 12

137
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,509
IP addresses and the smallest size sub

138
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:56,560
network that can accommodate 12 usable

139
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:59,289
IP addresses is a slash 28 the next

140
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,910
segment requires 31 IP addresses it

141
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,030
might be tempting to assign this network

142
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:07,150
another slash 27 but be careful a slash

143
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,949
27 has a total of 32 IP addresses but

144
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:11,319
only 30 of those are usable which

145
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:13,779
wouldn't be enough for us therefore to

146
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,909
accommodate 31 hosts we'll have to go to

147
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:21,039
the next size up which would be a slash

148
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,939
26 that takes care of our first step for

149
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,919
blsm Proms

150
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:25,959
which was simply to list out all the

151
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,589
required sub network sizes based upon

152
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,539
the needed amount of IP addresses the

153
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,250
second step for blsm proms is to

154
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,860
actually allocate sub networks to each

155
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,839
segment here's the key though the best

156
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,460
strategy to do this is from largest sub

157
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,189
network to smallest sub network

158
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:45,069
notice earlier we left this slash 28

159
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:46,569
orphan between allocated IP space now

160
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:48,310
this is an intrinsically a terrible

161
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,050
thing but we could avoid this entirely

162
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,240
if we allocated IP addresses from

163
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,770
biggest to smallest so from here on out

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,960
we'll follow that best practice and

165
00:06:53,769 --> 00:07:00,430
start with the biggest network which for

166
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:03,099
us will be this slash 26 the increments

167
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,780
for a slash 26 network is 64 so our

168
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,790
network IDs would have these IP

169
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:10,419
addresses and the first fully available

170
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:15,970
slash 26 network we can allocate is 99.9

171
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:19,210
dot 128 slash 26 the next biggest

172
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,650
network would be our slash 27 the

173
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:23,469
increments for a slash twenty-seven

174
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:26,469
network is 32 so our slash twenty sevens

175
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,360
will have these network IDs the next

176
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,150
fully available slash twenty seventh sub

177
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,600
network would be this one so we allocate

178
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:36,039
99.9 192 slash twenty seven to our

179
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,129
segment which requires a nineteen IP

180
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,080
addresses finally we take care of this

181
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,939
twenty eight the increment four slash

182
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:45,250
twenty eight is 16 which gives us these

183
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:46,959
network IDs and the next available slash

184
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,819
twenty eight network would be this one

185
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:55,479
so we allocate 99.9 two to 4/28 to this

186
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:57,310
last segment notice when we allocated a

187
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,050
piece based from biggest to smallest we

188
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,910
didn't leave any free blocks of IP

189
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,730
addresses stranded between allocated

190
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,250
blocks and that concludes step two of

191
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,259
vlsm proms which was to actually assign

192
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,209
sub networks based upon the sub network

193
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:14,110
sizes we determined we needed from the

194
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:16,569
first step which brings us to these two

195
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,270
segments which each only require two IP

196
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:21,129
addresses given that every router

197
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,959
interface must have an IP address in the

198
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:24,610
networks they are attached to we can

199
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,709
presume that the two IP address is

200
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,840
needed for this top segment are one for

201
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,759
each router interface the same is true

202
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,889
for the bottom Network each router

203
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,600
interface gets one IP address which is

204
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:37,600
where the required two IP addresses for

205
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,340
this network are coming from segments

206
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,899
with only two required IP addresses are

207
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,149
sometimes referred to as point-to-point

208
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,939
networks the only two members of the

209
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,559
segment are the routers themselves the

210
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,870
smallest size sub Network you can get

211
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,589
with two usable IP addresses would be a

212
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,560
slash 30 which is a total of 4

213
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,509
addresses and that is the size of a

214
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:01,679
subnetwork we will assign to each of our

215
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:04,080
point-to-point networks now we need to

216
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,149
carve out slash 30 sub networks our

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,460
visualization only went to slash 28

218
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,559
let's grab one available slash 28 and

219
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,170
use that to carve out smaller sub

220
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,750
networks we can break up that slash 28

221
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:18,299
into 2 slash 29 s with 8 IP addresses

222
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,960
each or four slash 30s with 4 IP

223
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:25,949
addresses each the slash 28 we started

224
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,870
with was 9.99 48 slash 28 which means

225
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,460
that network IDs for these slash 30s

226
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,080
start at dot 48 and each increased by 4

227
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,180
we can pick the first two to use in our

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,050
topology given these two point-to-point

229
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:47,099
segments the address space of 99.9 48

230
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:48,209
slash 30 and 99.9 dot 52 / 30 but

231
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,730
there's something I need to point out

232
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,769
here earlier we said that the smallest

233
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,310
sub network size that has two usable

234
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:59,279
addresses is a slash 30 that was true at

235
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:01,409
one point but an RFC was published which

236
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,199
allows the use of a slash 31 on

237
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:06,000
point-to-point networks the idea there

238
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,890
is if there's only one other note on

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,110
your network you'll never really need a

240
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:13,620
broadcast address so why have one at all

241
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:17,149
a slash 31 has two total IP addresses

242
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,470
and both are usable as host addresses

243
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,059
therefore while what we did is

244
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,070
acceptable for most entry level

245
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,809
certification exams it might not work

246
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,180
for more modern or professional and

247
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,069
senior level certification exams nor

248
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,838
would it work in the real world because

249
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,210
we could save more IP addresses if we

250
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,200
instead assign / 31 networks for a

251
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,200
point-to-point links

252
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,230
so we'll continue to carve out our slash

253
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:44,629
28 + 2 / 31 networks which have an

254
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,029
increment of 2 and we can simply pick

255
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:51,860
the first 2 / 30 ones to assign to our

256
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:54,740
point-to-point links and that my friends

257
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,649
is how to solve blsm questions to

258
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,629
summarize there are two steps the first

259
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,850
step is to determine and list out all

260
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:04,299
sub network sizes based upon the number

261
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,409
of IP addresses you need in each segment

262
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:08,240
remember to always pick the smallest

263
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:10,250
possible sub Network and to account for

264
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,789
usable addresses versus total addresses

265
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,799
in each block the second step is to

266
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:18,259
allocate IP address space from largest

267
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,149
sub Network to smallest making sure not

268
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:24,110
to use the same set of IP addresses for

269
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:27,289
multiple allocations and that concludes

270
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,310
the teaching on blsm questions I hope

271
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,750
you found the extension to the

272
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:32,000
subnetting mastery video series helpful

273
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,110
if you did I'm willing to bet that you

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,970
know someone else that would benefit

275
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,800
from these videos as well please let me

276
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,990
spread the word and share subnet ipv4

277
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,819
with your friends you can also get more

watching and have a great day

1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,759
hey youtube we are back with another

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,759
highly requested addition to the

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,440
subletting mastery video series

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,199
we've already expanded the video series

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,000
once when we discussed flsm

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,279
and vlsm and today because you asked for

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,399
it we're going to extend the series one

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,800
more time

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,679
this is video 10 of the subduty mastery

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,439
video series

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,879
and in this video we will pick apart the

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,079
concepts of super netting

13
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,919
summarization and ip aggregation

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,358
first let's begin by making sure we're

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
all on the same page and provide a

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
formal definition of supernetting

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,960
in the subnetting mastery video series

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
we define subnetting

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
as taking one network and dividing it

20
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,558
into sub networks

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:46,960
for example if we started with 9.9.9.0

22
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:50,159
24 that's a block of 256 ip addresses

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,280
we can break that up into two 25s

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,479
each with 128 ip addresses or 4

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,920
26s each with 64 ip addresses

26
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:02,878
or 8 27s or 16 28

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,679
and so on super netting is merely the

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,840
opposite

29
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,840
it's taking those sub networks and

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,439
summarizing them back into single

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,640
networks

32
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,719
i can take these two 28s and super net

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,359
them into that slash 27

34
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,158
or i can take these four slash 28s and

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,680
supernet them

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
into this slash 26. understand the terms

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,640
supernetting

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
and subnetting are relative to each

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,799
other

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,478
meaning this 26 is a supernet of these

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,600
four slash 28s

42
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,719
but this 26 is also a subnet of this

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,078
slash 25

44
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,359
or this 24. so keep in mind these terms

45
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,478
are simply relative to

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,599
other networks or subnetworks also i

47
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,599
want to mention that the terms

48
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,640
supernetting ip aggregation and

49
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,239
summarizing

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,759
are pretty much the same they are

51
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,039
interchangeable they are simply

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,640
different terms that all kind of mean

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,640
the same thing

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
with the definition out of the way we

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,239
are now going to show you

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
three examples of supernetting each of

57
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,718
which will show you

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
different situations you will encounter

59
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,399
when doing supernetting

60
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,399
first we're going to start by

61
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,919
summarizing these eight

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,439
consecutive 28 if you watch the

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,079
subnetting mastery video series

64
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,000
then you are familiar with this chart

65
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,400
this chart tells us that slash 28

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,318
networks have increments of 16

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,319
which means the network id for all the

68
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,199
slash 28s we are trying to summarize

69
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,479
look like this now if what we just did

70
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,079
to figure out the increments and the

71
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,679
network ids was confusing

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,040
go ahead and pause this video and go and

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,760
watch the subnetting mastery video

74
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,598
series

75
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,359
this process is picked apart in great

76
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,280
detail in that series

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,440
in any case we're going to use this

78
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,919
visualization to help us understand how

79
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,800
to summarize these eight slash 28s

80
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,679
into fewer networks we can start by

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,239
taking each

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,319
28 and summarizing them in pairs into

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,159
their slash 27 counterparts

84
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:56,878
this would give us 4 equal slash 27s

85
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,878
these 4 slash 27s are indeed

86
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,079
aggregations of these 8

87
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,199
28s but we can actually go a step

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
further

89
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,359
notice we can summarize these two slash

90
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,039
27s into a slash 26

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,400
and these two slash 27s into another 26

92
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,280
giving us a total of two slash 26s

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,800
these two 26s are the supernet of these

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,000
four slash 27s

95
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,799
and these eight flash 28s

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,039
but can we do even better than that well

97
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,239
if we continue to use this visualization

98
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,959
we can see that these two slash 26s fit

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,439
perfectly into this slash 25

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,120
which means we can summarize these 8 28s

101
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,560
or these four slash 27s

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,480
or these two 26s into this one

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,479
25. now i do want to point out

104
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,518
we could technically go further and

105
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:52,479
summarize these into a slash 24.

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
technically the 8 28 we meant to

107
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,399
summarize

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,039
absolutely fits inside this slash 24.

109
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
but if we summarize to the slash 24 we

110
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,719
would be inadvertently

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,438
also including ip addresses which we did

112
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,158
not mean

113
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,438
to initially include in fact we could

114
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,438
even go a step further

115
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:14,318
and summarize everything into 0.0.0.0

116
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,639
0. that would include every ip address

117
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,560
in the entire ipv4 internet

118
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,560
which certainly also includes these

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
eight 28s that we are trying to

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,680
summarize

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
but in both of those cases meaning the

122
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,400
slash 24 or the slash zero we were just

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,560
discussing

124
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,799
we end up including more ip addresses

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,478
than we mean to summarize

126
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
typically with soup netting you're

127
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,959
trying to get to the smallest

128
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,359
single network possible which means

129
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:41,758
9.9.9.0

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,800
25 is the best answer for this

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,520
particular superheading question

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
so we just went through our first simple

133
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,120
super netting exercise

134
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,959
but here's the thing it isn't always

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
going to work out as well as it did for

136
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,478
this problem

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
let me show you what i mean let's change

138
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,039
our problems that instead we are trying

139
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,160
to summarize

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,160
these six slash 28 networks

141
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
notice we removed these two from our

142
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,120
list

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,038
well these six 28s still fall in the

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
exact same slash 25

145
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,719
so if we wanted to summarize these into

146
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,039
a single network we could still do so

147
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,080
with 9.9.9.0

148
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,038
25. but notice

149
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,439
this 25 is now including ip addresses

150
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,599
which we did not mean to summarize

151
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,519
and if you look at this visualization we

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,800
can see that there really isn't a way

153
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,959
to go a step bigger or a step smaller

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
without also including ip addresses we

155
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,198
didn't mean to summarize

156
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,719
or excluding ip addresses we did mean to

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,879
summarize

158
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,639
so you see sometimes when you're doing

159
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,600
super netting your target is to

160
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,560
summarize everything

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,320
into a single network but other times

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
your target is going to be to summarize

163
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,560
into as few

164
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:57,359
networks as possible in this case

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
if we wanted to match these six slash

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
28s

167
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,520
exactly we would have to summarize these

168
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,160
two slash 28s into this slash 27

169
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,519
and these four slash 28s into this slash

170
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,639
26

171
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:14,318
giving us an exact match result of these

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,840
two networks okay

173
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,919
so which of these is the correct answer

174
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,399
then well

175
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,159
both it depends on what the question is

176
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,599
asking or what it is that you're trying

177
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
to accomplish

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,879
if you're trying to do something like

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
routing where you're trying to direct

180
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,240
traffic for these set of ip addresses to

181
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,079
a particular next hop

182
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,360
then it might be safe enough to simply

183
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,719
use a single route with a slash 25

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,639
but if you're doing something like

185
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
access control list which involves

186
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,240
giving access from these ip addresses to

187
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,478
specific resources

188
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,478
then maybe you want to be more explicit

189
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,639
with who you're trying to give access to

190
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,159
and would therefore want to use an exact

191
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,319
match

192
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,599
so both of these can be right answers

193
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
and when faced with super adding

194
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,079
problems you'll have to infer from the

195
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,079
question text

196
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,000
or the task at hand whether it makes

197
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,159
more sense to supernet to a single

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,279
network and potentially include ips you

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
didn't mean to

200
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,439
or supernet to as few networks as

201
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,758
possible potentially requiring multiple

202
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,839
lines in your configuration

203
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,800
so that's the idea behind summarizing to

204
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,560
a single network or an exact match

205
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,079
now there's one more example i want to

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,918
show you let's do

207
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,159
one more of these together before i test

208
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,879
you to see what you've learned

209
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,160
let's now try to summarize these eight

210
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,478
consecutive

211
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,280
28s each of these 28s has 16

212
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,079
ip addresses and if you do 8 times 16

213
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,918
that does indeed get you 128.

214
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,598
and if you look at this chart we can see

215
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,719
that a 25 network

216
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,199
has exactly 128 ip addresses which means

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,840
a slash 25 has enough ip addresses to

218
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,879
hold

219
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,959
these eight 28s this is how we were able

220
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
to summarize the eight slash 28s from

221
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,878
our first problem

222
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,560
into a single 25. but

223
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:02,000
take a look at where these 8 28s fall

224
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,639
if i try and summarize them as 9.9.9.0

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,038
25 i would only be accounting for these

226
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,240
top

227
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,719
6 slash 28s and if i try and summarize

228
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,840
them as 9.9.9.128

229
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:18,080
25 i would only be accounting for these

230
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:21,758
two slash 28s you see slash 25s

231
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:26,159
always fall either on dot 0 through 127

232
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,400
or on dot 128 through dot 255 even

233
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,960
though a slash 25 has enough ip

234
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,878
addresses

235
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,000
to account for all the slash 28s we mean

236
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,200
to summarize

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,799
there is no slash 25 that starts on

238
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,800
dot 32 and ends on dot 159

239
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,559
so for this particular problem because

240
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,759
of where the subnets are that we are

241
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,679
trying to summarize

242
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,838
we actually have to go a step further

243
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,199
and summarize all of these into a slash

244
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,959
24.

245
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,440
that's the only option we have to

246
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,838
summarize all eight of these slash 28s

247
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,560
into a single network

248
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,839
of course summarizing to the slash 24

249
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,359
also makes us include

250
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,200
a bunch of ip address space that we

251
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,959
didn't mean to include

252
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,839
but that is a common side effect when

253
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,319
you're trying to summarize to a single

254
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,320
network

255
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,600
instead if you want to summarize for an

256
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
exact match

257
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
we could summarize these two slash 28s

258
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,959
into this 27

259
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,800
these four slash 28s into this slash 26

260
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:25,359
and these two 28s into this slash 27

261
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,838
giving us an exact match summary of

262
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,720
these

263
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,720
three networks

264
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,360
at this point we've worked through three

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,959
summarization problems together

266
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,639
each of these progressively showed you

267
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,799
some of the nuance that is involved when

268
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:42,080
doing ip aggregation

269
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,479
now it's your turn i'm going to give you

270
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,800
three ip aggregation problems just like

271
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,639
we just did for you to solve

272
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,799
for each of them i want you to solve two

273
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,838
things i want you to summarize every

274
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,000
network into a

275
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,000
single network and i want you to

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,159
summarize every network into as few

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,320
networks as possible meaning summarize

278
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,838
to exact match

279
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,519
these three problems happen to be on the

280
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,519
next slide and i'll mention that on the

281
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,720
next slide i don't have room for this

282
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
subnetting chart

283
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,079
so you might want to quickly grab a

284
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,600
screenshot or jot this down

285
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:15,519
either way here are your three problems

286
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,320
problem a is going to have you summarize

287
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,159
these eight consecutive slash 28

288
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,160
problem b is going to have you summarize

289
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,120
these eight non-consecutive

290
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,078
slash 28s and finally problem c will

291
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,039
have you summarized

292
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,599
a mixed set of networks some slash 28

293
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,719
and a slash 27.

294
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
so go ahead and work through these

295
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
aggregation problems and again for each

296
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
of these

297
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
solve for two things summarize

298
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,679
everything to a single network or to an

299
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,359
exact match

300
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,359
go ahead and pause this video to work on

301
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,680
these problems i'll reveal the answers

302
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,839
in

303
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,838
10 seconds

304
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,360
for problem a to summarize these eight

305
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,679
28s

306
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,440
to a single network the only option you

307
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:05,039
have is to summarize to the entire

308
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,200
9.9.9.0 24

309
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,480
and to summarize them to an exact match

310
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,959
you can take these four

311
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,839
and summarize them to this slash 26 and

312
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,879
these four

313
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,640
28 and summarize them into that slash 26

314
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:21,679
giving us an exact match value of 999.64

315
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:25,039
26 and 999.128

316
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,439
26. for problem b

317
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,039
to summarize to a single network again

318
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,519
your only option is to summarize

319
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,559
everything

320
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,480
to 9.9.9.0.24

321
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,599
and to summarize them to an exact match

322
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,320
you can take these two

323
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
28s and summarize them into a slash 27

324
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,040
these

325
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,399
four slash 28s and summarize them into a

326
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,480
slash 26

327
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,200
and finally these two slash 28s and

328
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,480
summarize them into this slash 27

329
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,879
giving you an exact match value of

330
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,079
999.32

331
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:58,799
27 999.128 26

332
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,799
and 999.224 27.

333
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,159
and finally for problem c to summarize

334
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,120
all five of these networks into a single

335
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,159
network

336
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:12,159
you can use this 25 giving us a single

337
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,838
network answer of 999.0025

338
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,278
and summarizing them to an exact match

339
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,560
you're going to see is going to be a

340
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,799
little tricky

341
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,559
this slash 28 actually cannot be

342
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,078
summarized into anything else

343
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,759
the next size network would be a slash

344
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,159
27 and it includes

345
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,519
ipspace we didn't mean to summarize so

346
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,159
this slash 28

347
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,480
has to stay as a slash 28 and it's the

348
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,639
same for that slash 28 right there

349
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,039
because of where these slash 27s fall

350
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,399
there is no way to summarize those two

351
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,559
28s this slash 27 and

352
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,039
these two slash 28s can both be

353
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,359
summarized into this slash 26

354
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,599
giving us an exact match summarization

355
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,079
answer of these three networks

356
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,120
notice the two slash 28s are the two

357
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,719
original slash 28s we met to summarize

358
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
the only one we were actually able to

359
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
summarize was this guy down here

360
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,199
summarizing these networks into this

361
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,200
slash 26.

362
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,799
at this point you've seen six

363
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,799
supernatural problems

364
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,958
we did three together in the beginning

365
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,639
and then just now we tested you on these

366
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,479
three problems

367
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
hopefully now you understand what

368
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,800
supernating problems are asking you to

369
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,480
do

370
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,078
and hopefully you have come to realize

371
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,120
that it isn't a very difficult

372
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:25,199
task or at least it isn't difficult if

373
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,799
you have these cool visualizations

374
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,639
of all the ip addresses and different

375
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,000
subnet blocks that'll help you find the

376
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,000
right answer

377
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,120
but in the real world or on a

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,879
certification exam

379
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
you aren't going to have the luxury of

380
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,240
this cool table

381
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
but lucky for you you can solve

382
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,799
superheading problems using only scratch

383
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,159
paper

384
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,639
and that is what i'm going to show you

385
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,639
next now i do want to mention

386
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,639
that super netting for exact match by

387
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,320
hand is pretty rare

388
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,079
especially if you're taking entry-level

389
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,920
certification exams

390
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,838
moreover there isn't really a way to

391
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,759
shortcut the process other than simply

392
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,519
calculating the network id and the next

393
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,879
network values manually

394
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,320
which is something you'll get better and

395
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,679
better at as you spend more time

396
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,839
subletting

397
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,638
instead much more commonly you'll be

398
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,560
asked to supernet to a single network

399
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,680
you'll be given certain subnets or

400
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,359
certain ip addresses

401
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,679
and you'll be asked to find a single

402
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,440
network which they all fall into

403
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,198
luckily this is something that is pretty

404
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
easy to do quickly and i'm going to show

405
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,639
you how

406
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,480
in the subnetting mastery video series i

407
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,278
taught you how to solve for these

408
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,120
seven attributes i told you that every

409
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,480
subjecting problem you ever encounter is

410
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,278
simply asking you to solve

411
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,199
for one or more of these values well for

412
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,600
supernetting the two attributes we'll be

413
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,599
using

414
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,600
are the network id and the broadcast ip

415
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,800
so let me show you how to use these two

416
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
values to solve

417
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,399
supernating problems we're going to

418
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,359
start by summarizing

419
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,879
these six slash 28s if these look

420
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
familiar to you it's because it's the

421
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,439
same

422
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,240
28s we worked through earlier i just

423
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,120
wanted to start with something familiar

424
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,399
supernating by hand only requires two

425
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,720
steps

426
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,600
the first step is to find the smallest

427
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
ip address

428
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,879
and the largest ip address now notice i

429
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,000
said

430
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,000
ip address and not subnets

431
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,078
so the smallest ip address for our

432
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,799
problem set is going to be the network

433
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,078
id

434
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:20,879
of the lowest numerical subnet meaning

435
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,799
this one and since this problem has

436
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,879
already given us the network id

437
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:30,479
we know that the smallest ip address is

438
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:32,000
going to be 9.9.9.0

439
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,240
then we're going to try and find the

440
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,159
largest ip address and the largest ip

441
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,799
address is going to be the last ip

442
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,958
address in the highest numerical subnet

443
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,719
which is going to be that one now the

444
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,958
last ip address in that subnet

445
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,879
is the broadcast ip address so we simply

446
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,000
have to solve for the broadcast ip

447
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,958
of this subnet well this is a slash 28

448
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,399
and a slash 28 has an increment of 16 so

449
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:59,119
if we add 16 to 112 we would get 128.

450
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,120
of course 128 is the next network value

451
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,799
so we have to do minus 1 to get us a

452
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,959
broadcast ip address

453
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:10,879
of 9.9.9.127

454
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,638
now everything we just did in so far

455
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,078
solving for the network id and broadcast

456
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
is stuff we covered in the subnetting

457
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,198
mastery video series

458
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
so if you're unsure how i solved those

459
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,799
as quickly as i did definitely check out

460
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,958
that series

461
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,679
in any case this actually completes step

462
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,679
one we have our smallest ip address and

463
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,078
our largest epi address which lets us

464
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,479
move on to step two

465
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,439
step two is to find a group size

466
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,519
increment

467
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,600
that includes both the smallest and

468
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,159
largest ip address

469
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,759
so if we subtract 127 from 0 we get 127

470
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,919
so we know that we need an increment

471
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,959
that is at least 127.

472
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:52,719
this means all of these are too small

473
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:55,919
all the way until i get to a slash 25

474
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,000
a slash 25 has an increment of 128

475
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,278
which is enough to account for the jump

476
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,839
we need

477
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,558
and since there's a slash 25 that starts

478
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,199
at 9.9.9.0

479
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,000
this gives us our answer the supernet of

480
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,519
v6

481
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,599
28 is 9.9.9.0

482
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:20,078
25. just like that we were able to solve

483
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,838
for the supernet of these six slash 28s

484
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,000
and you'll notice we got the same answer

485
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:27,119
as we did when we used the large chart

486
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,759
and did this visually notice we didn't

487
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,079
have to do

488
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,359
anything with the ips and subnets in the

489
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,839
middle

490
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,599
the thing is if we find a subnet that

491
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,879
includes the smallest ip address and the

492
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,719
largest ip address

493
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,440
it's definitely also going to include

494
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,360
all the ip address space in the middle

495
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,798
and just like that with only these two

496
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,759
steps we have solved

497
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,480
our first supernetting problem but i

498
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,200
want to show you

499
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,240
a few more examples i have five more

500
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,279
problems that we are going to work

501
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,359
through together

502
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,639
and as before each of them will show you

503
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,879
something different in regards to

504
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,480
supernetting

505
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
for the next problem we're going to

506
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,440
remove these two slash 28s

507
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,559
and summarize the remaining four slash

508
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
28s

509
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,798
and we're still going to use the exact

510
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
same two-step process

511
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,720
first we'll start by identifying the

512
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,240
smallest ip and the largest ip

513
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,880
and the smallest ip address will be the

514
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
network id of that subnet right there

515
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,440
so our smallest ip address is going to

516
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,279
be 9.9.9.64

517
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,519
the largest ip address is going to be

518
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,798
the broadcast ip address of the highest

519
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,879
numerical subnet

520
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:37,359
which for us is 9.9.9.112 28.

521
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,960
now this is the same subnet as last time

522
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,678
so the broadcast ip address hasn't

523
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
changed

524
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
we know that it's 9.9.9.1

525
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,200
and from here we'll just find an

526
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,440
increment that includes both the

527
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,798
smallest and largest ip address

528
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,600
well if we do 127 minus 64 that gets us

529
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,319
63 which means all of these are too

530
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,159
small

531
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:03,720
until we get to 64 which is a slash 26

532
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,360
and since a slash 26 happens to start on

533
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,519
9.9.9.64

534
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:14,000
right away we have our answer of 9.9.9

535
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:16,480
dots 26.

536
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,679
this right here is the super net for

537
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,038
these four

538
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,600
28s and just like that we have solved

539
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,480
another one

540
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:28,159
using these two steps let's do one more

541
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,679
our next problem is going to involve

542
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,480
super netting mixed

543
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,400
size networks notice here we have a

544
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,200
slash 29 a slash 27

545
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,759
slash 26 and slash 28. we're going to

546
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,558
still use the same two-step process

547
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,640
to find the supernet we'll start by

548
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,960
identifying the smallest ip address

549
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,038
which is going to be the network id of

550
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
the lowest numerical subnet

551
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,519
which for us is going to be that guy

552
00:19:50,960 --> 00:20:00,880
right there which means our smallest ip

553
00:19:53,519 --> 00:20:02,960
address is going to be 9.9.9.128.

554
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,400
our largest ip address is going to be

555
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
the broadcast ip

556
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,440
of the highest numerical subnet which

557
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
for us

558
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,880
looks like this guy right there this is

559
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,839
a slash 29

560
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
which is an increment of 8 which means

561
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,199
if we add 8

562
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,480
to that guy we get 240 plus 8 gets us

563
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,319
248

564
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,240
again that's the next network so if we

565
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,439
do minus one that'll give us the

566
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,599
broadcast ip

567
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,200
of our largest numerical subnet which

568
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:33,519
means our largest ip address

569
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:35,600
is 9.9.9.247.

570
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,440
and again we now just need to find a

571
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,759
group size increment which includes

572
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,200
both the smallest and largest ip address

573
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,480
if we do 247

574
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,319
minus 128 that gets us 119

575
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
which means instantly we can rule out

576
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,639
all of these network and go straight

577
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,440
to a slash 25 which is the first network

578
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,440
that is big enough

579
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,279
to account for this jump and since there

580
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,600
happens to be a slash 25

581
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,960
that starts on our smallest ip address

582
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,639
dot 128

583
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,079
we instantly know that the answer to

584
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:08,960
this super supernatural problem

585
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:11,519
is 9.9.9.128.25

586
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,480
so that is our third supernating problem

587
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,200
and again you'll see

588
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,400
we just used those two steps and this

589
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,000
time we summarize

590
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
networks of mixed sizes

591
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,119
so far every supernating problem we've

592
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,000
worked through together

593
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,359
has been using subnets but occasionally

594
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,319
you're going to run into supernating

595
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,359
problems that involve

596
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,519
summarizing individual ip addresses

597
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,558
well either way the same two-step

598
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,279
process will work

599
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,359
to solve the supernet again we're going

600
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,079
to start by identifying the smallest ip

601
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,119
address

602
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,879
which for us looks like this guy and the

603
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,199
largest ip address which for us

604
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,120
looks like this guy since they've

605
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
already given us ip addresses we don't

606
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,158
need to calculate network ids or

607
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
broadcast ips

608
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,240
we can go straight to step 2 which is to

609
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,038
find a group size increments that

610
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,720
includes

611
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:04,000
140 and dot 170. now if you subtract

612
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,079
170 from 140 we get 30 which means we

613
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,240
need a jump of at least 30.

614
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:11,599
this lets us rule out all of these

615
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,079
networks until we get to a slash 27.

616
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,000
but we have to be careful here if we

617
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,839
take slash 27 networks

618
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,599
and we list out their increments in sets

619
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:24,079
of 32 we would get

620
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:26,079
0.32 dot 64.

621
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,759
now of course in the subnetting mastery

622
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,519
video series i showed you some speed

623
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,798
tips that'll let you speed this process

624
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,639
along

625
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:35,759
one of those speed tips told us we can

626
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,600
simply start from 128.

627
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,798
again if you haven't seen that series

628
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,480
definitely check that out

629
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,519
i go into more detail about these

630
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,360
shortcuts either way from 128 if we

631
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,839
continue in sets of 32

632
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:52,479
we would get 160 then

633
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:54,480
192 and we can stop here

634
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,200
notice the ip addresses we are trying to

635
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,519
solve 140 through 170

636
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,240
start somewhere in here and end

637
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:05,119
somewhere in here in the next block

638
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,519
which means even though a slash 27 is

639
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,479
enough

640
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,679
ip addresses to account for this jump

641
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,558
these two addresses

642
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,080
happen to exist in two different slash

643
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,558
27s

644
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,759
which means a slash 27 is not going to

645
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:23,119
be big enough to include this entire set

646
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:26,558
instead we have to go one step further

647
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,678
and go to a slash 26 the increment of

648
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,359
slash 26

649
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:35,519
is 64. and if we start at 128

650
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:38,158
the next increment is going to be 192

651
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,279
and between these two values we do have

652
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,559
enough to include

653
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,200
all the ap addresses we're trying to

654
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:47,038
summarize which means the answer to this

655
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,038
super netting problem is going to be

656
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,080
9.9.9.128

657
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,200
26. so keep in mind

658
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,678
just because you have enough ip

659
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
addresses doesn't necessarily mean

660
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,038
that's going to be the right size to

661
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,240
include all the ip addresses you need to

662
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,839
include

663
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,599
this is similar to the third

664
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,439
visualization exercise we did

665
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,879
in the beginning of this video so feel

666
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,720
free to check that out if you're unsure

667
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,360
what just happened

668
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,319
as for us we're going to continue now so

669
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,759
far

670
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,079
all of the subnetting problems we've

671
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,319
done together have all fallen

672
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,399
in the fourth octet what i'm going to

673
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,038
show you next is how to do supernetting

674
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
problems

675
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,359
that involve the third octet we are now

676
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,000
going to summarize

677
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,479
these eight ip addresses that involve

678
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,278
different

679
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,960
third octets now of course if we are

680
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,119
going to the third octet

681
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,558
we need to extend our subnetting chart

682
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,719
one more line

683
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,480
and again i discuss how to do this in

684
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,839
video six of the subletting mastery

685
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,839
series

686
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,038
from here we can use the exact same

687
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,480
two-step process

688
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:50,079
to supernet these eight ip addresses

689
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,079
now again we'll start by finding the

690
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,879
smallest ip address and the largest ip

691
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,038
address

692
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,400
the smallest ip address for us looks

693
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,960
like this guy

694
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,440
and the largest ip address for us looks

695
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,960
like

696
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,360
this guy so if we write that out

697
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:11,840
to make it a little bit easier to see we

698
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:13,359
have 9.9.4.146 as our smallest ip

699
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:18,720
address

700
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:21,759
and 9.9.4.209

701
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,159
as our largest ip address

702
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,158
now we just need to find a group size

703
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,960
increment that's going to span

704
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,600
these two ip addresses but notice the

705
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,319
steps say

706
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,199
in the relevant octet since there are

707
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,240
different values

708
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,759
in the third octet the third octet is

709
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,839
the relevant octet

710
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,519
which means i'm trying to find a group

711
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,759
size increment that'll span

712
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,879
44 and 47. now if we subtract out 47 and

713
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,278
44 we get

714
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,400
three that lets me rule out those two

715
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,480
sizes right there

716
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,400
which brings me to this column over here

717
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,519
and a slash 22.

718
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,480
let's see if a slash 22 will work

719
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,158
again a slash 22 has an increment of 4

720
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,839
in the third octet

721
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,600
and we can use one of the speed tips

722
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,240
that we learned in video 5

723
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,000
of the subdating mastery series to start

724
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,960
at dot 40.

725
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,400
from there we can go to dot 44 and then

726
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,038
dot 48

727
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,880
and just like that we have found a jump

728
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,400
which includes the ip addresses we need

729
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,480
to summarize

730
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,519
which means the answer to this super

731
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,038
netting prom

732
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:32,798
is going to be 9.9.44.0

733
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:35,359
22. just like that we have solved

734
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,240
a super netting problem using these two

735
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,678
steps

736
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,240
and the third octet so you see no matter

737
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,798
what

738
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,599
these two steps are all you need and at

739
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,519
the end of the day

740
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,839
all you're doing is finding an increment

741
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,960
which includes a smallest ip address and

742
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,480
the largest ip address

743
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,240
the last problem we're going to work

744
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,960
through together involves

745
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,000
another problem using the third octet

746
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,319
except this time

747
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,839
we'll be solving for mixed networks that

748
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,038
span both the fourth

749
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,480
and the third octet again we'll start

750
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,480
the exact same way

751
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,159
we'll find the smallest ip address and

752
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,839
the largest ip address

753
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,080
well the smallest ip address is going to

754
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,558
be the network id of the lowest

755
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,839
numerical network which looks like that

756
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,759
guy right there

757
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:26,000
which means our smallest ip address is

758
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:27,679
going to be 9.9.162.0

759
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,440
and our largest ip address is going to

760
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,559
be the broadcast ip

761
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,640
of the highest numerical address

762
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,119
which looks like that guy right there

763
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,720
that is a slash 27 network

764
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,599
if you look at our subletting chart a

765
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,919
slash 27 is an increment of 32

766
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,319
and since this is a slash 27 we're

767
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,759
incrementing that in the fourth octet

768
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:53,200
so if we add 32 to 160 that gets us

769
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,440
192 and then we do minus one that gives

770
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,480
us

771
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,000
a broadcast ip address of 191

772
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,159
and then if we fill in the remaining

773
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,720
octets we know that the largest ip

774
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,120
address

775
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,880
in this subnet is going to be

776
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:09,199
9.9.170.191

777
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,360
now we can move on to step two which is

778
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,319
to find a group size increment in the

779
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,119
relevant octet

780
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,720
which includes both but you have to be

781
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,918
careful with this one

782
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,960
if we subtract 170 from 162 that would

783
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,640
get us 8

784
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,200
which would bring us to a slash 21.

785
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,759
but you have to be careful here because

786
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,159
8

787
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:35,599
would be a jump from 999.162.0

788
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:38,880
through 999 170.0

789
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,119
it wouldn't include 191.

790
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,120
we actually need to find a jump that

791
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,199
includes eight in the third octet

792
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,879
plus a little bit more to account for

793
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,960
our fourth octet

794
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,720
so eight is actually not going to be big

795
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,679
enough for this particular super netting

796
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,319
problem

797
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,759
so we have to go a step further all the

798
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,879
way to slash 20

799
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,558
which gives us an increment of 16 and

800
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,120
again we can use a speed tip

801
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,398
of multiplying it by 10 to let us start

802
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,959
at 160

803
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,000
and if we increase that by 16 that would

804
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,038
mean that the next

805
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,038
network would be 176.

806
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,278
right there we have found a jump that

807
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,158
includes both the smallest and largest

808
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,640
ip address

809
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,640
and so right there we have our answer of

810
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:26,558
9.9.160.0

811
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,038
slash 20. just like that we were able to

812
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,678
solve

813
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,119
using only scratch paper and our handy

814
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,038
subnetting chart

815
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,038
another supernatural prompt that

816
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,319
involved mixed size networks in the

817
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,319
third and fourth octet

818
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,439
at this point we've worked through six

819
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,159
super netting problems together

820
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,840
using only pen and paper and our handy

821
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,760
subnetting chart

822
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,278
hopefully by now you feel pretty good

823
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,200
about how to solve supernetting and

824
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:55,038
aggregation problems

825
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,240
as i said before mastery doesn't come

826
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,759
without practice

827
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,120
so find a buddy and give each other

828
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,640
summarization prompts so you can

829
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,639
practice together

830
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,080
a great place to find such a buddy is

and we'll see you in the next one

1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,759
hey youtube we are back with another

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,759
highly requested addition to the

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,440
subletting mastery video series

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,199
we've already expanded the video series

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,000
once when we discussed flsm

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,279
and vlsm and today because you asked for

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,399
it we're going to extend the series one

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,800
more time

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,679
this is video 10 of the subduty mastery

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,439
video series

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,879
and in this video we will pick apart the

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,079
concepts of super netting

13
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,919
summarization and ip aggregation

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,358
first let's begin by making sure we're

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
all on the same page and provide a

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
formal definition of supernetting

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,960
in the subnetting mastery video series

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
we define subnetting

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
as taking one network and dividing it

20
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,558
into sub networks

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:46,960
for example if we started with 9.9.9.0

22
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:50,159
24 that's a block of 256 ip addresses

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,280
we can break that up into two 25s

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,479
each with 128 ip addresses or 4

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,920
26s each with 64 ip addresses

26
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:02,878
or 8 27s or 16 28

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,679
and so on super netting is merely the

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,840
opposite

29
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,840
it's taking those sub networks and

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,439
summarizing them back into single

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,640
networks

32
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,719
i can take these two 28s and super net

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,359
them into that slash 27

34
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,158
or i can take these four slash 28s and

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,680
supernet them

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
into this slash 26. understand the terms

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,640
supernetting

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
and subnetting are relative to each

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,799
other

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,478
meaning this 26 is a supernet of these

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,600
four slash 28s

42
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,719
but this 26 is also a subnet of this

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,078
slash 25

44
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,359
or this 24. so keep in mind these terms

45
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,478
are simply relative to

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,599
other networks or subnetworks also i

47
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,599
want to mention that the terms

48
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,640
supernetting ip aggregation and

49
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,239
summarizing

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,759
are pretty much the same they are

51
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,039
interchangeable they are simply

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,640
different terms that all kind of mean

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,640
the same thing

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
with the definition out of the way we

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,239
are now going to show you

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
three examples of supernetting each of

57
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,718
which will show you

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
different situations you will encounter

59
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,399
when doing supernetting

60
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,399
first we're going to start by

61
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,919
summarizing these eight

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,439
consecutive 28 if you watch the

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,079
subnetting mastery video series

64
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,000
then you are familiar with this chart

65
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,400
this chart tells us that slash 28

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,318
networks have increments of 16

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,319
which means the network id for all the

68
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,199
slash 28s we are trying to summarize

69
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,479
look like this now if what we just did

70
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,079
to figure out the increments and the

71
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,679
network ids was confusing

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,040
go ahead and pause this video and go and

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,760
watch the subnetting mastery video

74
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,598
series

75
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,359
this process is picked apart in great

76
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,280
detail in that series

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,440
in any case we're going to use this

78
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,919
visualization to help us understand how

79
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,800
to summarize these eight slash 28s

80
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,679
into fewer networks we can start by

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,239
taking each

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,319
28 and summarizing them in pairs into

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,159
their slash 27 counterparts

84
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:56,878
this would give us 4 equal slash 27s

85
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,878
these 4 slash 27s are indeed

86
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,079
aggregations of these 8

87
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,199
28s but we can actually go a step

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
further

89
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,359
notice we can summarize these two slash

90
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,039
27s into a slash 26

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,400
and these two slash 27s into another 26

92
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,280
giving us a total of two slash 26s

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,800
these two 26s are the supernet of these

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,000
four slash 27s

95
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,799
and these eight flash 28s

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,039
but can we do even better than that well

97
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,239
if we continue to use this visualization

98
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,959
we can see that these two slash 26s fit

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,439
perfectly into this slash 25

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,120
which means we can summarize these 8 28s

101
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,560
or these four slash 27s

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,480
or these two 26s into this one

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,479
25. now i do want to point out

104
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,518
we could technically go further and

105
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:52,479
summarize these into a slash 24.

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
technically the 8 28 we meant to

107
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,399
summarize

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,039
absolutely fits inside this slash 24.

109
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
but if we summarize to the slash 24 we

110
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,719
would be inadvertently

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,438
also including ip addresses which we did

112
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,158
not mean

113
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,438
to initially include in fact we could

114
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,438
even go a step further

115
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:14,318
and summarize everything into 0.0.0.0

116
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,639
0. that would include every ip address

117
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,560
in the entire ipv4 internet

118
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,560
which certainly also includes these

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
eight 28s that we are trying to

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,680
summarize

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
but in both of those cases meaning the

122
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,400
slash 24 or the slash zero we were just

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,560
discussing

124
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,799
we end up including more ip addresses

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,478
than we mean to summarize

126
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
typically with soup netting you're

127
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,959
trying to get to the smallest

128
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,359
single network possible which means

129
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:41,758
9.9.9.0

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,800
25 is the best answer for this

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,520
particular superheading question

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
so we just went through our first simple

133
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,120
super netting exercise

134
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,959
but here's the thing it isn't always

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
going to work out as well as it did for

136
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,478
this problem

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
let me show you what i mean let's change

138
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,039
our problems that instead we are trying

139
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,160
to summarize

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,160
these six slash 28 networks

141
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
notice we removed these two from our

142
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,120
list

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,038
well these six 28s still fall in the

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
exact same slash 25

145
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,719
so if we wanted to summarize these into

146
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,039
a single network we could still do so

147
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,080
with 9.9.9.0

148
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,038
25. but notice

149
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,439
this 25 is now including ip addresses

150
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,599
which we did not mean to summarize

151
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,519
and if you look at this visualization we

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,800
can see that there really isn't a way

153
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,959
to go a step bigger or a step smaller

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
without also including ip addresses we

155
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,198
didn't mean to summarize

156
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,719
or excluding ip addresses we did mean to

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,879
summarize

158
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,639
so you see sometimes when you're doing

159
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,600
super netting your target is to

160
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,560
summarize everything

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,320
into a single network but other times

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
your target is going to be to summarize

163
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,560
into as few

164
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:57,359
networks as possible in this case

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
if we wanted to match these six slash

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
28s

167
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,520
exactly we would have to summarize these

168
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,160
two slash 28s into this slash 27

169
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,519
and these four slash 28s into this slash

170
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,639
26

171
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:14,318
giving us an exact match result of these

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,840
two networks okay

173
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,919
so which of these is the correct answer

174
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,399
then well

175
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,159
both it depends on what the question is

176
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,599
asking or what it is that you're trying

177
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
to accomplish

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,879
if you're trying to do something like

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
routing where you're trying to direct

180
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,240
traffic for these set of ip addresses to

181
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,079
a particular next hop

182
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,360
then it might be safe enough to simply

183
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,719
use a single route with a slash 25

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,639
but if you're doing something like

185
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
access control list which involves

186
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,240
giving access from these ip addresses to

187
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,478
specific resources

188
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,478
then maybe you want to be more explicit

189
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,639
with who you're trying to give access to

190
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,159
and would therefore want to use an exact

191
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,319
match

192
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,599
so both of these can be right answers

193
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
and when faced with super adding

194
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,079
problems you'll have to infer from the

195
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,079
question text

196
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,000
or the task at hand whether it makes

197
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,159
more sense to supernet to a single

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,279
network and potentially include ips you

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
didn't mean to

200
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,439
or supernet to as few networks as

201
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,758
possible potentially requiring multiple

202
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,839
lines in your configuration

203
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,800
so that's the idea behind summarizing to

204
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,560
a single network or an exact match

205
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,079
now there's one more example i want to

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,918
show you let's do

207
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,159
one more of these together before i test

208
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,879
you to see what you've learned

209
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,160
let's now try to summarize these eight

210
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,478
consecutive

211
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,280
28s each of these 28s has 16

212
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,079
ip addresses and if you do 8 times 16

213
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,918
that does indeed get you 128.

214
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,598
and if you look at this chart we can see

215
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,719
that a 25 network

216
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,199
has exactly 128 ip addresses which means

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,840
a slash 25 has enough ip addresses to

218
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,879
hold

219
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,959
these eight 28s this is how we were able

220
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
to summarize the eight slash 28s from

221
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,878
our first problem

222
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,560
into a single 25. but

223
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:02,000
take a look at where these 8 28s fall

224
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,639
if i try and summarize them as 9.9.9.0

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,038
25 i would only be accounting for these

226
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,240
top

227
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,719
6 slash 28s and if i try and summarize

228
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,840
them as 9.9.9.128

229
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:18,080
25 i would only be accounting for these

230
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:21,758
two slash 28s you see slash 25s

231
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:26,159
always fall either on dot 0 through 127

232
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,400
or on dot 128 through dot 255 even

233
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,960
though a slash 25 has enough ip

234
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,878
addresses

235
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,000
to account for all the slash 28s we mean

236
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,200
to summarize

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,799
there is no slash 25 that starts on

238
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,800
dot 32 and ends on dot 159

239
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,559
so for this particular problem because

240
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,759
of where the subnets are that we are

241
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,679
trying to summarize

242
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,838
we actually have to go a step further

243
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,199
and summarize all of these into a slash

244
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,959
24.

245
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,440
that's the only option we have to

246
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,838
summarize all eight of these slash 28s

247
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,560
into a single network

248
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,839
of course summarizing to the slash 24

249
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,359
also makes us include

250
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,200
a bunch of ip address space that we

251
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,959
didn't mean to include

252
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,839
but that is a common side effect when

253
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,319
you're trying to summarize to a single

254
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,320
network

255
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,600
instead if you want to summarize for an

256
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
exact match

257
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
we could summarize these two slash 28s

258
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,959
into this 27

259
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,800
these four slash 28s into this slash 26

260
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:25,359
and these two 28s into this slash 27

261
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,838
giving us an exact match summary of

262
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,720
these

263
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,720
three networks

264
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,360
at this point we've worked through three

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,959
summarization problems together

266
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,639
each of these progressively showed you

267
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,799
some of the nuance that is involved when

268
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:42,080
doing ip aggregation

269
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,479
now it's your turn i'm going to give you

270
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,800
three ip aggregation problems just like

271
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,639
we just did for you to solve

272
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,799
for each of them i want you to solve two

273
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,838
things i want you to summarize every

274
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,000
network into a

275
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,000
single network and i want you to

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,159
summarize every network into as few

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,320
networks as possible meaning summarize

278
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,838
to exact match

279
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,519
these three problems happen to be on the

280
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,519
next slide and i'll mention that on the

281
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,720
next slide i don't have room for this

282
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
subnetting chart

283
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,079
so you might want to quickly grab a

284
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,600
screenshot or jot this down

285
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:15,519
either way here are your three problems

286
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,320
problem a is going to have you summarize

287
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,159
these eight consecutive slash 28

288
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,160
problem b is going to have you summarize

289
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,120
these eight non-consecutive

290
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,078
slash 28s and finally problem c will

291
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,039
have you summarized

292
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,599
a mixed set of networks some slash 28

293
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,719
and a slash 27.

294
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
so go ahead and work through these

295
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
aggregation problems and again for each

296
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
of these

297
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
solve for two things summarize

298
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,679
everything to a single network or to an

299
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,359
exact match

300
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,359
go ahead and pause this video to work on

301
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,680
these problems i'll reveal the answers

302
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,839
in

303
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,838
10 seconds

304
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,360
for problem a to summarize these eight

305
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,679
28s

306
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,440
to a single network the only option you

307
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:05,039
have is to summarize to the entire

308
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,200
9.9.9.0 24

309
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,480
and to summarize them to an exact match

310
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,959
you can take these four

311
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,839
and summarize them to this slash 26 and

312
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,879
these four

313
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,640
28 and summarize them into that slash 26

314
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:21,679
giving us an exact match value of 999.64

315
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:25,039
26 and 999.128

316
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,439
26. for problem b

317
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,039
to summarize to a single network again

318
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,519
your only option is to summarize

319
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,559
everything

320
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,480
to 9.9.9.0.24

321
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,599
and to summarize them to an exact match

322
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,320
you can take these two

323
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
28s and summarize them into a slash 27

324
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,040
these

325
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,399
four slash 28s and summarize them into a

326
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,480
slash 26

327
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,200
and finally these two slash 28s and

328
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,480
summarize them into this slash 27

329
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,879
giving you an exact match value of

330
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,079
999.32

331
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:58,799
27 999.128 26

332
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,799
and 999.224 27.

333
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,159
and finally for problem c to summarize

334
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,120
all five of these networks into a single

335
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,159
network

336
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:12,159
you can use this 25 giving us a single

337
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,838
network answer of 999.0025

338
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,278
and summarizing them to an exact match

339
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,560
you're going to see is going to be a

340
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,799
little tricky

341
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,559
this slash 28 actually cannot be

342
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,078
summarized into anything else

343
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,759
the next size network would be a slash

344
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,159
27 and it includes

345
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,519
ipspace we didn't mean to summarize so

346
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,159
this slash 28

347
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,480
has to stay as a slash 28 and it's the

348
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,639
same for that slash 28 right there

349
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,039
because of where these slash 27s fall

350
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,399
there is no way to summarize those two

351
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,559
28s this slash 27 and

352
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,039
these two slash 28s can both be

353
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,359
summarized into this slash 26

354
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,599
giving us an exact match summarization

355
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,079
answer of these three networks

356
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,120
notice the two slash 28s are the two

357
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,719
original slash 28s we met to summarize

358
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
the only one we were actually able to

359
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
summarize was this guy down here

360
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,199
summarizing these networks into this

361
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,200
slash 26.

362
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,799
at this point you've seen six

363
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,799
supernatural problems

364
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,958
we did three together in the beginning

365
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,639
and then just now we tested you on these

366
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,479
three problems

367
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
hopefully now you understand what

368
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,800
supernating problems are asking you to

369
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,480
do

370
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,078
and hopefully you have come to realize

371
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,120
that it isn't a very difficult

372
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:25,199
task or at least it isn't difficult if

373
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,799
you have these cool visualizations

374
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,639
of all the ip addresses and different

375
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,000
subnet blocks that'll help you find the

376
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,000
right answer

377
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,120
but in the real world or on a

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,879
certification exam

379
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
you aren't going to have the luxury of

380
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,240
this cool table

381
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
but lucky for you you can solve

382
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,799
superheading problems using only scratch

383
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,159
paper

384
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,639
and that is what i'm going to show you

385
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,639
next now i do want to mention

386
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,639
that super netting for exact match by

387
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,320
hand is pretty rare

388
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,079
especially if you're taking entry-level

389
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,920
certification exams

390
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,838
moreover there isn't really a way to

391
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,759
shortcut the process other than simply

392
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,519
calculating the network id and the next

393
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,879
network values manually

394
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,320
which is something you'll get better and

395
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,679
better at as you spend more time

396
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,839
subletting

397
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,638
instead much more commonly you'll be

398
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,560
asked to supernet to a single network

399
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,680
you'll be given certain subnets or

400
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,359
certain ip addresses

401
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,679
and you'll be asked to find a single

402
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,440
network which they all fall into

403
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,198
luckily this is something that is pretty

404
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,639
easy to do quickly and i'm going to show

405
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,639
you how

406
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,480
in the subnetting mastery video series i

407
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,278
taught you how to solve for these

408
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,120
seven attributes i told you that every

409
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,480
subjecting problem you ever encounter is

410
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,278
simply asking you to solve

411
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,199
for one or more of these values well for

412
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:35,600
supernetting the two attributes we'll be

413
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,599
using

414
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,600
are the network id and the broadcast ip

415
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,800
so let me show you how to use these two

416
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
values to solve

417
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,399
supernating problems we're going to

418
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,359
start by summarizing

419
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,879
these six slash 28s if these look

420
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
familiar to you it's because it's the

421
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,439
same

422
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,240
28s we worked through earlier i just

423
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,120
wanted to start with something familiar

424
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,399
supernating by hand only requires two

425
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,720
steps

426
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,600
the first step is to find the smallest

427
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
ip address

428
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,879
and the largest ip address now notice i

429
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,000
said

430
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,000
ip address and not subnets

431
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,078
so the smallest ip address for our

432
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,799
problem set is going to be the network

433
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,078
id

434
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:20,879
of the lowest numerical subnet meaning

435
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,799
this one and since this problem has

436
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,879
already given us the network id

437
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:30,479
we know that the smallest ip address is

438
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:32,000
going to be 9.9.9.0

439
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,240
then we're going to try and find the

440
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,159
largest ip address and the largest ip

441
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,799
address is going to be the last ip

442
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,958
address in the highest numerical subnet

443
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,719
which is going to be that one now the

444
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,958
last ip address in that subnet

445
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,879
is the broadcast ip address so we simply

446
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,000
have to solve for the broadcast ip

447
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,958
of this subnet well this is a slash 28

448
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,399
and a slash 28 has an increment of 16 so

449
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:59,119
if we add 16 to 112 we would get 128.

450
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,120
of course 128 is the next network value

451
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,799
so we have to do minus 1 to get us a

452
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,959
broadcast ip address

453
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:10,879
of 9.9.9.127

454
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,638
now everything we just did in so far

455
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,078
solving for the network id and broadcast

456
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
is stuff we covered in the subnetting

457
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,198
mastery video series

458
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
so if you're unsure how i solved those

459
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,799
as quickly as i did definitely check out

460
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,958
that series

461
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,679
in any case this actually completes step

462
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,679
one we have our smallest ip address and

463
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,078
our largest epi address which lets us

464
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,479
move on to step two

465
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,439
step two is to find a group size

466
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,519
increment

467
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,600
that includes both the smallest and

468
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,159
largest ip address

469
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,759
so if we subtract 127 from 0 we get 127

470
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,919
so we know that we need an increment

471
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,959
that is at least 127.

472
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:52,719
this means all of these are too small

473
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:55,919
all the way until i get to a slash 25

474
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,000
a slash 25 has an increment of 128

475
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,278
which is enough to account for the jump

476
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,839
we need

477
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,558
and since there's a slash 25 that starts

478
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,199
at 9.9.9.0

479
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,000
this gives us our answer the supernet of

480
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,519
v6

481
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,599
28 is 9.9.9.0

482
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:20,078
25. just like that we were able to solve

483
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,838
for the supernet of these six slash 28s

484
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,000
and you'll notice we got the same answer

485
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:27,119
as we did when we used the large chart

486
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,759
and did this visually notice we didn't

487
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,079
have to do

488
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,359
anything with the ips and subnets in the

489
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,839
middle

490
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,599
the thing is if we find a subnet that

491
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,879
includes the smallest ip address and the

492
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,719
largest ip address

493
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,440
it's definitely also going to include

494
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,360
all the ip address space in the middle

495
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,798
and just like that with only these two

496
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,759
steps we have solved

497
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,480
our first supernetting problem but i

498
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,200
want to show you

499
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,240
a few more examples i have five more

500
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,279
problems that we are going to work

501
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,359
through together

502
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,639
and as before each of them will show you

503
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,879
something different in regards to

504
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,480
supernetting

505
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
for the next problem we're going to

506
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,440
remove these two slash 28s

507
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,559
and summarize the remaining four slash

508
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
28s

509
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,798
and we're still going to use the exact

510
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
same two-step process

511
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,720
first we'll start by identifying the

512
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,240
smallest ip and the largest ip

513
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,880
and the smallest ip address will be the

514
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
network id of that subnet right there

515
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,440
so our smallest ip address is going to

516
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,279
be 9.9.9.64

517
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,519
the largest ip address is going to be

518
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,798
the broadcast ip address of the highest

519
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,879
numerical subnet

520
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:37,359
which for us is 9.9.9.112 28.

521
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,960
now this is the same subnet as last time

522
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,678
so the broadcast ip address hasn't

523
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
changed

524
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
we know that it's 9.9.9.1

525
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,200
and from here we'll just find an

526
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,440
increment that includes both the

527
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,798
smallest and largest ip address

528
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,600
well if we do 127 minus 64 that gets us

529
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,319
63 which means all of these are too

530
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,159
small

531
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:03,720
until we get to 64 which is a slash 26

532
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,360
and since a slash 26 happens to start on

533
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,519
9.9.9.64

534
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:14,000
right away we have our answer of 9.9.9

535
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:16,480
dots 26.

536
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,679
this right here is the super net for

537
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,038
these four

538
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,600
28s and just like that we have solved

539
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,480
another one

540
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:28,159
using these two steps let's do one more

541
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,679
our next problem is going to involve

542
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,480
super netting mixed

543
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,400
size networks notice here we have a

544
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,200
slash 29 a slash 27

545
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,759
slash 26 and slash 28. we're going to

546
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,558
still use the same two-step process

547
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,640
to find the supernet we'll start by

548
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,960
identifying the smallest ip address

549
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,038
which is going to be the network id of

550
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
the lowest numerical subnet

551
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,519
which for us is going to be that guy

552
00:19:50,960 --> 00:20:00,880
right there which means our smallest ip

553
00:19:53,519 --> 00:20:02,960
address is going to be 9.9.9.128.

554
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,400
our largest ip address is going to be

555
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
the broadcast ip

556
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,440
of the highest numerical subnet which

557
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
for us

558
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,880
looks like this guy right there this is

559
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,839
a slash 29

560
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
which is an increment of 8 which means

561
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,199
if we add 8

562
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,480
to that guy we get 240 plus 8 gets us

563
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,319
248

564
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,240
again that's the next network so if we

565
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,439
do minus one that'll give us the

566
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,599
broadcast ip

567
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,200
of our largest numerical subnet which

568
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:33,519
means our largest ip address

569
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:35,600
is 9.9.9.247.

570
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,440
and again we now just need to find a

571
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,759
group size increment which includes

572
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,200
both the smallest and largest ip address

573
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,480
if we do 247

574
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,319
minus 128 that gets us 119

575
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
which means instantly we can rule out

576
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,639
all of these network and go straight

577
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,440
to a slash 25 which is the first network

578
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,440
that is big enough

579
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,279
to account for this jump and since there

580
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,600
happens to be a slash 25

581
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,960
that starts on our smallest ip address

582
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,639
dot 128

583
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,079
we instantly know that the answer to

584
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:08,960
this super supernatural problem

585
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:11,519
is 9.9.9.128.25

586
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,480
so that is our third supernating problem

587
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,200
and again you'll see

588
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,400
we just used those two steps and this

589
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,000
time we summarize

590
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
networks of mixed sizes

591
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,119
so far every supernating problem we've

592
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,000
worked through together

593
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,359
has been using subnets but occasionally

594
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,319
you're going to run into supernating

595
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,359
problems that involve

596
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,519
summarizing individual ip addresses

597
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,558
well either way the same two-step

598
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,279
process will work

599
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,359
to solve the supernet again we're going

600
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,079
to start by identifying the smallest ip

601
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,119
address

602
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,879
which for us looks like this guy and the

603
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,199
largest ip address which for us

604
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,120
looks like this guy since they've

605
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
already given us ip addresses we don't

606
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,158
need to calculate network ids or

607
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
broadcast ips

608
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,240
we can go straight to step 2 which is to

609
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,038
find a group size increments that

610
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,720
includes

611
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:04,000
140 and dot 170. now if you subtract

612
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,079
170 from 140 we get 30 which means we

613
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,240
need a jump of at least 30.

614
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:11,599
this lets us rule out all of these

615
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,079
networks until we get to a slash 27.

616
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,000
but we have to be careful here if we

617
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,839
take slash 27 networks

618
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,599
and we list out their increments in sets

619
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:24,079
of 32 we would get

620
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:26,079
0.32 dot 64.

621
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,759
now of course in the subnetting mastery

622
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,519
video series i showed you some speed

623
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,798
tips that'll let you speed this process

624
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,639
along

625
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:35,759
one of those speed tips told us we can

626
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,600
simply start from 128.

627
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,798
again if you haven't seen that series

628
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,480
definitely check that out

629
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,519
i go into more detail about these

630
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,360
shortcuts either way from 128 if we

631
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,839
continue in sets of 32

632
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:52,479
we would get 160 then

633
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:54,480
192 and we can stop here

634
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,200
notice the ip addresses we are trying to

635
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,519
solve 140 through 170

636
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,240
start somewhere in here and end

637
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:05,119
somewhere in here in the next block

638
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,519
which means even though a slash 27 is

639
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,479
enough

640
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,679
ip addresses to account for this jump

641
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,558
these two addresses

642
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,080
happen to exist in two different slash

643
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,558
27s

644
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,759
which means a slash 27 is not going to

645
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:23,119
be big enough to include this entire set

646
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:26,558
instead we have to go one step further

647
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,678
and go to a slash 26 the increment of

648
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,359
slash 26

649
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:35,519
is 64. and if we start at 128

650
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:38,158
the next increment is going to be 192

651
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,279
and between these two values we do have

652
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,559
enough to include

653
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,200
all the ap addresses we're trying to

654
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:47,038
summarize which means the answer to this

655
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,038
super netting problem is going to be

656
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,080
9.9.9.128

657
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,200
26. so keep in mind

658
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,678
just because you have enough ip

659
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
addresses doesn't necessarily mean

660
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,038
that's going to be the right size to

661
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,240
include all the ip addresses you need to

662
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,839
include

663
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,599
this is similar to the third

664
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,439
visualization exercise we did

665
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,879
in the beginning of this video so feel

666
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,720
free to check that out if you're unsure

667
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,360
what just happened

668
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,319
as for us we're going to continue now so

669
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,759
far

670
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,079
all of the subnetting problems we've

671
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,319
done together have all fallen

672
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,399
in the fourth octet what i'm going to

673
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,038
show you next is how to do supernetting

674
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
problems

675
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,359
that involve the third octet we are now

676
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,000
going to summarize

677
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,479
these eight ip addresses that involve

678
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,278
different

679
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,960
third octets now of course if we are

680
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,119
going to the third octet

681
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,558
we need to extend our subnetting chart

682
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,719
one more line

683
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,480
and again i discuss how to do this in

684
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,839
video six of the subletting mastery

685
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,839
series

686
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,038
from here we can use the exact same

687
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,480
two-step process

688
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:50,079
to supernet these eight ip addresses

689
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,079
now again we'll start by finding the

690
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,879
smallest ip address and the largest ip

691
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,038
address

692
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,400
the smallest ip address for us looks

693
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,960
like this guy

694
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,440
and the largest ip address for us looks

695
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,960
like

696
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,360
this guy so if we write that out

697
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:11,840
to make it a little bit easier to see we

698
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:13,359
have 9.9.4.146 as our smallest ip

699
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:18,720
address

700
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:21,759
and 9.9.4.209

701
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,159
as our largest ip address

702
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,158
now we just need to find a group size

703
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,960
increment that's going to span

704
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,600
these two ip addresses but notice the

705
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,319
steps say

706
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,199
in the relevant octet since there are

707
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,240
different values

708
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,759
in the third octet the third octet is

709
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,839
the relevant octet

710
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,519
which means i'm trying to find a group

711
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,759
size increment that'll span

712
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,879
44 and 47. now if we subtract out 47 and

713
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,278
44 we get

714
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,400
three that lets me rule out those two

715
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,480
sizes right there

716
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,400
which brings me to this column over here

717
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,519
and a slash 22.

718
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,480
let's see if a slash 22 will work

719
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,158
again a slash 22 has an increment of 4

720
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,839
in the third octet

721
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,600
and we can use one of the speed tips

722
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,240
that we learned in video 5

723
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,000
of the subdating mastery series to start

724
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,960
at dot 40.

725
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,400
from there we can go to dot 44 and then

726
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,038
dot 48

727
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,880
and just like that we have found a jump

728
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,400
which includes the ip addresses we need

729
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,480
to summarize

730
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,519
which means the answer to this super

731
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,038
netting prom

732
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:32,798
is going to be 9.9.44.0

733
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:35,359
22. just like that we have solved

734
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,240
a super netting problem using these two

735
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,678
steps

736
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,240
and the third octet so you see no matter

737
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,798
what

738
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,599
these two steps are all you need and at

739
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,519
the end of the day

740
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,839
all you're doing is finding an increment

741
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,960
which includes a smallest ip address and

742
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,480
the largest ip address

743
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,240
the last problem we're going to work

744
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,960
through together involves

745
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,000
another problem using the third octet

746
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,319
except this time

747
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,839
we'll be solving for mixed networks that

748
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,038
span both the fourth

749
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,480
and the third octet again we'll start

750
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,480
the exact same way

751
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,159
we'll find the smallest ip address and

752
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,839
the largest ip address

753
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,080
well the smallest ip address is going to

754
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,558
be the network id of the lowest

755
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,839
numerical network which looks like that

756
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,759
guy right there

757
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:26,000
which means our smallest ip address is

758
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:27,679
going to be 9.9.162.0

759
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,440
and our largest ip address is going to

760
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,559
be the broadcast ip

761
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,640
of the highest numerical address

762
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,119
which looks like that guy right there

763
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,720
that is a slash 27 network

764
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,599
if you look at our subletting chart a

765
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,919
slash 27 is an increment of 32

766
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,319
and since this is a slash 27 we're

767
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,759
incrementing that in the fourth octet

768
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:53,200
so if we add 32 to 160 that gets us

769
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,440
192 and then we do minus one that gives

770
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,480
us

771
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,000
a broadcast ip address of 191

772
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,159
and then if we fill in the remaining

773
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,720
octets we know that the largest ip

774
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,120
address

775
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,880
in this subnet is going to be

776
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:09,199
9.9.170.191

777
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,360
now we can move on to step two which is

778
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,319
to find a group size increment in the

779
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,119
relevant octet

780
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,720
which includes both but you have to be

781
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,918
careful with this one

782
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,960
if we subtract 170 from 162 that would

783
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,640
get us 8

784
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,200
which would bring us to a slash 21.

785
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,759
but you have to be careful here because

786
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,159
8

787
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:35,599
would be a jump from 999.162.0

788
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:38,880
through 999 170.0

789
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,119
it wouldn't include 191.

790
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,120
we actually need to find a jump that

791
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,199
includes eight in the third octet

792
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,879
plus a little bit more to account for

793
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,960
our fourth octet

794
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,720
so eight is actually not going to be big

795
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,679
enough for this particular super netting

796
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,319
problem

797
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,759
so we have to go a step further all the

798
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,879
way to slash 20

799
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,558
which gives us an increment of 16 and

800
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,120
again we can use a speed tip

801
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,398
of multiplying it by 10 to let us start

802
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,959
at 160

803
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,000
and if we increase that by 16 that would

804
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,038
mean that the next

805
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,038
network would be 176.

806
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,278
right there we have found a jump that

807
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,158
includes both the smallest and largest

808
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,640
ip address

809
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,640
and so right there we have our answer of

810
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:26,558
9.9.160.0

811
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,038
slash 20. just like that we were able to

812
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,678
solve

813
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,119
using only scratch paper and our handy

814
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,038
subnetting chart

815
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,038
another supernatural prompt that

816
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,319
involved mixed size networks in the

817
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,319
third and fourth octet

818
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,439
at this point we've worked through six

819
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,159
super netting problems together

820
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,840
using only pen and paper and our handy

821
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,760
subnetting chart

822
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,278
hopefully by now you feel pretty good

823
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,200
about how to solve supernetting and

824
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:55,038
aggregation problems

825
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,240
as i said before mastery doesn't come

826
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,759
without practice

827
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,120
so find a buddy and give each other

828
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,640
summarization prompts so you can

829
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,639
practice together

830
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,080
a great place to find such a buddy is

831
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,440
our new discord server

832
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,519
join us at pragnet.net discord

833
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,880
and that my friends brings this lesson

834
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,639
to a close

835
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,000
i hope you enjoyed this lesson on super

836
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,520
netting

837
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,038

and we'll see you in the next one

1
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,640
okay

2
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,640
well hello everybody

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
i'm excited to be doing this first live

4
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,399
stream i guess we still a few minutes

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,879
before before uh

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,558
30 after when i said we'd start but i

7
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:45,839
figured this is not a bad time to test

8
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,679
the video and audio

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,039
video looking okay give me a thumbs up

10
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,558
or something in the chat let me know if

11
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,840
you guys can see me okay

12
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,839
everything's coming through all right

13
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,358
also the plan for the day welcome if

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
you're joining us the plan for the day

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,640
is to go through a little bit of vlsm

16
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,839
training

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
hopefully most of you have seen the

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
subnet ipv4 videos or the subnetting

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
mastery video playlist

20
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,200
if you have go and let me know in the

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
chat room just so i have an idea of

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,159
where we're all starting

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,719
and what we're going to be doing today

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
in this stream is essentially continuing

25
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,798
where that live stream sorry where those

26
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,719
that video series ended

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,400
and so we'll run through a quick kind of

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,959
uh review

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,159
of what was covered in the subnet ipv4

30
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,599
videos

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,520
and then from there we'll just continue

32
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,478
dive we'll dive right into

33
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,078
some subnetting training by the way this

34
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,359
is the first live stream i've ever done

35
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,359
inevitably there'll be some sort of

36
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,959
technical uh difficulties

37
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,200
just bear with me as we kind of work

38
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,199
through it for starters every time i pop

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
out the chat in the youtube live stream

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:54,640
video

41
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:57,599
it seems to uh crash on me

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,718
so i guess we'll do it this way then hey

43
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:09,840
jeremy

44
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:09,840
good to see you glad you could join

45
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,878
okay let's get to it

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,640
so i'm going to move my face

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
off to the left over here

48
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,439
okay so if you've sat through

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
if you've sat through the subnetting

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,360
video series then you've seen

51
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,598
this slide in this slide we talked

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
through how you can take a slash 24

53
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,199
network represented by this

54
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,439
yellow box right there and break it up

55
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,119
into a bunch of different size networks

56
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,159
on the example right now you see a slash

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
25 couple slash 27 and a slash 26.

58
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,598
we explain in the subnetting mastery

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,640
video series that that's all subnetting

60
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,639
is it's taking

61
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,679
one network and dividing it into sub

62
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,359
networks into smaller networks

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,719
then we walk through these seven

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
attributes of subnetting

65
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,158
we explain what each one of them are and

66
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,439
showed you exactly how to solve

67
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,280
for each of those using this cheat sheet

68
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,400
now again all this was covered in the

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,560
subnetting mastery video series

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,640
so this should all be review but in that

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
series we went through these steps

72
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,158
and used this cheat sheet to be able to

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,879
extract these seven pieces of

74
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,759
information

75
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,439
from any ip address and subnet mask now

76
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
in that series i told you that

77
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,359
every subnetting question you ever

78
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,759
encounter is only going to be

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
solving for one or more of these seven

80
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,560
attributes

81
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,959
you're going to see that proven again

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,039
today as we do vlsm

83
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:47,840
in particular the next network one is

84
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,840
going to be very important

85
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,840
cool so i'm just checking on the chat

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:58,080
over here uh

87
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,400
n19ns the videos are at subnet ipv4.com

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,239
chen is complaining or mentioning that

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
the video stream is pretty low

90
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,280
how's the video seen stream quality for

91
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,079
the rest of you you guys getting a

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:15,840
a decent stream go and mention something

93
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,840
in the chat room if you could

94
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,639
thanks jeremy jen it might be something

95
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,839
local

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
cool awesome to hear yeah chan it might

97
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,799
be something local

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
in any case uh if you haven't seen those

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,840
videos

100
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,319
subnet ipv4.com is uh where they're all

101
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,918
posted

102
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,839
in those videos so again we use this

103
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,799
cheat sheet these steps to solve these

104
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,239
seven things

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,759
so after i showed you that i showed you

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
how to do it faster using these four

107
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
speed tips

108
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,400
and that's what led us into our flsm and

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,079
vlsm discussions

110
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,679
first we went through flsm which had us

111
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,639
stepping through this illustration where

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
we talked about how

113
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,720
you can take one subnet and break it up

114
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,478
into smaller subnets

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
and every time you do you double the

116
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,680
amount of networks regardless of where

117
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,479
you start so we'll play that again just

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
for kicks

119
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,240
if you start at slash zero again

120
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
doubling that going to slash ones would

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,680
go to two slash ones

122
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,959
if you start at slash tens going to

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
slash elevens would get you

124
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,120
two slash elevens or four slash twelves

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,759
and so on

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
we use that to answer these types of

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,960
questions

128
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,560
questions that essentially have you

129
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,918
break up one network into many different

130
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
networks that are all the same

131
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,279
size that's what makes this an flsm

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
question

133
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,319
fixed length subnet mask because all

134
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,879
those networks you break everything up

135
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,839
into

136
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,279
are all the same size finally in the

137
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,119
series we ran through

138
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,918
this illustration where we did a vlsm

139
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,720
problem with vlsm we had a network

140
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,399
topology

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
that had a different requirements for a

142
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,560
certain amount of ip addresses on each

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
network and then we broke up this slash

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,038
24

145
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,360
that they gave us the 999.0624 network

146
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,159
into appropriately side blocks and we

147
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,280
used this

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,680
neat visualization so we could see

149
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,000
exactly which blocks were going to which

150
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,918
uh particular networks

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,478
now the point the point of using this

152
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,959
visualization was as an illustration

153
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,199
tool

154
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,799
to show you what vlsm problems are doing

155
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,079
what you're trying to do with the vlsum

156
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,079
prom

157
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,599
i think it's a very effective way to

158
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,159
teach vlsp

159
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
but in an actual cisco exam or any other

160
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,600
network certification exam

161
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,199
you're not going to have time to draw

162
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,479
out a large chart like this

163
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,400
to do vlsm problems that's the point of

164
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,959
today's training

165
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,839
is i'm going to show you how to do these

166
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,318
types of problems

167
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,839
using only a paper and pen or a scratch

168
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
pad or whatever they give you for

169
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,918
for your exam so hopefully that brings

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,560
everybody up to speed with what we're

171
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,560
going to be doing

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,038
if uh that's all sitting well with you

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,279
guys go ahead and

174
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,318
mention something in chat give me a

175
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,839
thumbs up or

176
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,800
emoji or something like that just let me

177
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:17,839
know that you guys are still with me and

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:17,840
everything's going good

179
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:31,918
hit cool it does look like the chat

180
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
is further delayed than the actual live

181
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,799
stream looks like the live stream it's

182
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,239
only four or five seconds and the chat

183
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,919
is 15 seconds so

184
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,680
i guess that's something i'll have to

185
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,918
get used to it or figure out in the

186
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
future

187
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,038
in any case let's uh let's get right

188
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,919
into it

189
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,800
so i have a couple things already kind

190
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,799
of prepped for us

191
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,399
that's this whiteboard session right

192
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,679
here so on this whiteboard session

193
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,198
we've got the cheat sheet because we're

194
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,478
going to make use of that and again if

195
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,000
you are unfamiliar with the cheat sheet

196
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,279
you can draw it out we showed you that

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,519
in video two of the

198
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,038
of the subnetting mastery video series

199
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,560
and then we have this topology now it's

200
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,519
the same topology we were using

201
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,079
in the subnet mastery video series but

202
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
honestly

203
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,120
the topology is pretty arbitrary we're

204
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,240
going to use the topology

205
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,840
right here just because it already

206
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,038
exists but it doesn't really matter what

207
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,399
it looks like

208
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,079
and you'll notice this and you'll see

209
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,799
this rather because the next problem we

210
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,719
do together

211
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,280
is not going to have a topology at all

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,240
but this will help us kind of

213
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,799
ground ground the concepts in what we

214
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,200
already know

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,158
at least that's the plan now just to

216
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,959
prove to you

217
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:41,360
that this isn't that this isn't a

218
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,518
pre-built scenario or anything like that

219
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,639
i have put together

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,639
a little script

221
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,079
that just generates random numbers right

222
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,439
uh i don't know what numbers are going

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
to be are going to come up from this

224
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
right and i can show you guys the code

225
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
for the script it's just a little bash

226
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,959
script nothing nothing too special

227
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,959
get rid of this guy

228
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,799
but the point is i have no idea what

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,160
this is going to be doing or what this

230
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,599
is going to generate and we're going to

231
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,399
solve we're going to use these random

232
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,800
numbers

233
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,000
in fact in a random order we're going to

234
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,199
use these random numbers

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,839
to solve a new blsm problem that you or

236
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,040
i or no one else has ever seen before

237
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,080
and i'm going to do this to kind of show

238
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,519
you the steps required to solve the lsm

239
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,399
quickly and easy

240
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,639
so this looks like a let's do another

241
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,639
one

242
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
sorry look perfect this looks like a

243
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,958
good place to start so we're going to

244
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,239
solve

245
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:41,119
vlsm for these six networks

246
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,159
as the six networks that belong on this

247
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,278
or rather

248
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,799
not networks as the six number of

249
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,200
required ip addresses we're going to

250
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,159
need in each one of these

251
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
subnetworks meaning this network right

252
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,000
here

253
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,079
is going to need four ip addresses

254
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,759
the next one down is going to need 15 ip

255
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,879
address the next one is going to need

256
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:06,399
25 the next one is going to need 11

257
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,799
and then 62 and then 14.

258
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,039
and again i'm just i'm just put picking

259
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,799
them from what we have over here

260
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,078
and these are all randomly generated so

261
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,359
again i've never seen this before this

262
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,879
isn't something i've pre-scripted or

263
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,879
whatever the case

264
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,200
we are still going to be using the

265
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,679
9.9.9.0

266
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
24 network but again that the ip address

267
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,078
you start with is

268
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,078
largely arbitrary you'll see that the

269
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,120
rules we discuss sort of

270
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:34,559
apply regardless of what you start with

271
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,159
okay so with that said in the videos

272
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,599
i told you guys the first step you

273
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,399
should do when you're doing vlsm

274
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,480
problems

275
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,679
is to figure out the appropriate size

276
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,639
network you need

277
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,000
for every uh every network size that

278
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,639
you've been given

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,759
so for us we were given six different

280
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,278
network sizes

281
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,200
and what we're going to start by doing

282
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,600
is figuring out what size network we

283
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,240
need

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
for each of those networks so if you

285
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
watch the vlsm

286
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,879
sorry if you watch the subjecting

287
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
mastery video series you know that this

288
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,519
chart

289
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,880
has three lines and the first line is

290
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,078
essentially going to tell you the number

291
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,799
of ip addresses

292
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,559
in each size network and so we can use

293
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,838
that to quickly determine

294
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,838
what size we need to assign to each of

295
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
those

296
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,679
we'll do that in pink so for this

297
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:25,200
network right here i need four i p

298
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,799
addresses now it might be tempting to be

299
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
like okay cool there's a four right

300
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,599
there

301
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,399
a slash thirty is four i p addresses but

302
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,399
remember

303
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,240
this first column first row rather is

304
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,200
showing you four

305
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,759
usable sorry four total ip addresses not

306
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,160
four

307
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,958
usable ip addresses to get the usable ip

308
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,958
addresses you have to

309
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,159
you have to subtract by two so while

310
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,559
this has given us four

311
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,958
total ip addresses it's only two usable

312
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,239
addresses so a slash 30 will not work

313
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,958
for that network right there instead

314
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,440
we'll use a slash 29 which gives us a

315
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,278
total of eight addresses or

316
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,360
six usable addresses which is going to

317
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,679
be enough

318
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
for this first network and then what we

319
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,239
just did we'll just do

320
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:11,359
again for all the other networks in uh

321
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,560
in our vlsm problem

322
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
so over here for 15 again it's tempting

323
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,078
to just

324
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,278
look at that 16 to determine that oh

325
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:20,879
that's that's going to be big enough but

326
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,240
again we have to account for the minus 2

327
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,679
and the usable addresses

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,839
so for that guy we're actually going to

329
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,838
need to assign a slash 27.

330
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,720
for this guy we need 25 ip addresses

331
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,880
32 gives us 30 usable ip addresses so we

332
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,879
can still use a slash 27 for that guy

333
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,278
and then derek to answer your question

334
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,760
yes this is going to be recorded i'll be

335
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,919
posting this to my discord server

336
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,879
sometime the next day or two if you want

337
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:58,078
to see what you missed

338
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:01,200
cool so for that guy we need 11

339
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,199
clean this up a little bit

340
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,240
that would be enough for 11 giving us a

341
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,720
slash 28 for that network

342
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,639
for 62 a slash 26 gives us 64. total ip

343
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,959
addresses are 62 usable so it is

344
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,480
just barely enough we'll make that a

345
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,958
slash 96

346
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,200
and then for 14 down there this guy will

347
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,479
again be enough

348
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,160
so that will be a slash 28. so that

349
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,759
takes care of kind of the first step of

350
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,559
any vlsm problems

351
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,000
essentially assigning out what size

352
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,359
network you're going to need

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,278
for every single network in your

354
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,800
topology based upon

355
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,720
the requirements provided by the

356
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,879
question in so far as how many ip

357
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,759
addresses you need on each network

358
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,439
which for us we just picked out randomly

359
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,278
now so far

360
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,880
let me check in with you all in the chat

361
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,159
if every is everything sitting well with

362
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,039
you guys so far

363
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:56,399
if so say something in the chat or a

364
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,399
thumbs up or an emoji or

365
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
whatever

366
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,919
cool

367
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
cool cool cool

368
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,159
thanks daryl for uh the literal

369
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,040
interpretation i like it

370
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,198
okay now as you guys can see my

371
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,719
handwriting on the screen is not amazing

372
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,799
so what i'm gonna do is use this notepad

373
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,600
box over here to to give our final

374
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,240
answers

375
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,720
and what we've do so far is that this

376
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,879
first network is going to be a slash 29

377
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
this network this rather i guess the

378
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,439
second one down from the top is gonna be

379
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,320
a slash 27

380
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
this third one is going to be a slash 27

381
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,240
also

382
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,240
this guy let's go one here

383
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,879
that guy is going to be a slash 28 that

384
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,919
guy's going to be a slash 26

385
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,759
and this guy is going to be a slash 28.

386
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,078
so all we've done is we've taken what we

387
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,439
did before and then we've just kind of

388
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,679
wrote them down as our little answer

389
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,399
sheet notepad so it's a little bit more

390
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,399
uh legible

391
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,959
cool so now the second part of vlsm

392
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,440
questions

393
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,479
is actually assigning out ip address

394
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,560
blocks

395
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,360
to accommodate for the size of networks

396
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,278
that we need based on what we just did

397
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,519
and this is the part where we go back to

398
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,399
the seven attributes of subnetting

399
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,440
in particular using the next network

400
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,720
field

401
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,600
so let's do this so we'll start over

402
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,639
here

403
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,959
we were given the 9.9.9.0

404
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:42,959
24 network so i'm going to write that

405
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:46,319
right here at the top

406
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:49,838
i know the first network i assign

407
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,519
is going to start with 9.9.9.0

408
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,040
i just need to figure out the proper

409
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,078
increments to account for

410
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,439
all the other networks on this list now

411
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:02,000
the way to solve these

412
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,560
is by starting from largest to smallest

413
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,320
so here the largest network in our

414
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,799
topology is going to be this guy right

415
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,720
here

416
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:12,559
our slash 26 well if we look at our

417
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,800
submitting cheat sheet we know that a

418
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,518
slash 26 has a next

419
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,198
rather has an increment of 64. which

420
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,560
means if i was trying to break up

421
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:26,319
my 9.9.9.0 24 network into

422
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,518
26's i would go in sets of 64.

423
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,839
so the first jump would take me to 64.

424
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,799
the next jump would take me to 128 and

425
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:40,160
the next one would take me to 160

426
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:43,039
wow math fail 162. that's not right at

427
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,039
all 192.

428
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,120
now that would work that would work

429
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,959
if we were trying to break it up into

430
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,560
you know just sets of four

431
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,638
slash 26s but we only need one slash 26

432
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,479
to account for this problem

433
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,558
so really i didn't need to go this far

434
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,199
this is going to be the slash 26 network

435
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,480
that i'm going to assign

436
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,919
to that network so it's going to be this

437
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,199
guy right here 9.9.9.0

438
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,038
26. but if you recall from the

439
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,640
subnetting

440
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:23,119
mastery videos the increment

441
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,520
after your starting point is the next

442
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,519
network

443
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,519
so this right here is the netid that i'm

444
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,399
using and then the next value

445
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,879
dot 64 is the next network what that

446
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,440
means

447
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,320
is the next size network if it's slap if

448
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,200
it's a slash

449
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,599
26 or smaller is going to start on dot

450
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
six

451
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,119
on dot 64. so i can use that as my

452
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
starting point for what's next

453
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,558
so let's do that in a different color

454
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,558
oops that's not the eraser

455
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,000
so after

456
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:01,678
after my slash 26 the next size

457
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,160
network insofar as biggest to smallest

458
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,640
would be

459
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,200
the two slash 27s right here it's

460
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,759
convenient

461
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
right next to each other if we look at

462
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,599
our chart

463
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,798
a slash 27 has an increment of 32 which

464
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,159
means i can start

465
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:20,240
from this guy right here in sets of 32.

466
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:24,798
so dot 64 then dot 96

467
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,000
2. 128

468
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,839
if i did the math right these two

469
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,839
net ids that i have the arrow pointing

470
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:35,038
to are the net ids

471
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:38,720
for these two slash 27s

472
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,079
and this guy 128 is the next network

473
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
that i'll be starting from

474
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,599
going forward so we can fill in our

475
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,600
answer sheet over here

476
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:53,759
9.9.9.64

477
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,319
and 9.9.9.96

478
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,558
and where we start next is going to be

479
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,319
on the 128.

480
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,399
so let me check in with you all make

481
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,319
sure everything is tracking so well

482
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,320
tracking so far go and let me know in

483
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,000
the chat if everything is going okay

484
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:25,839
and i will spend that time cleaning up

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:25,839
the picture a little bit

486
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,720
cool cool if there's any questions

487
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,319
definitely just throw them out into the

488
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,640
chat and i'll uh

489
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,079
and i'll grab them in these pulse checks

490
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,120
i think going forward if i'm going to do

491
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,119
these live streams

492
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,558
i'd love to find a quicker way to

493
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,000
interact with the audience so i might

494
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,200
have to look into that

495
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,519
but that's another story

496
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
cool so we're just going to continue

497
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,960
continue with the same pattern

498
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,279
we've left off at 128 we've taken care

499
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,919
of assigning

500
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,359
network ids for these two 27s and this

501
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,759
slash 26

502
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,519
so the next size network if you continue

503
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,640
on from biggest to smallest will be our

504
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,639
slash 28

505
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,080
and again there's two of them so that's

506
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,000
them right there

507
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,599
and if you look at our chart a slash 28

508
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,400
has an increment of 16

509
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,038
and i'm just going to continue from 128

510
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,960
in sets

511
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,960
of 16. so our first network id

512
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,000
for a slash 28 will be that guy right

513
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:35,200
there our next one is going to be

514
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:36,640
uh 1 44 if i did the math right

515
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,880
that would actually give me the network

516
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,120
id for both

517
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,080
slash 28 but again i have to solve the

518
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,158
next network

519
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,119
to know where i'm going to start going

520
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,240
forward

521
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:51,119
so i have to go one more 144

522
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,519
plus 16 would get us 160. that right

523
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,798
there

524
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,720
is the next network that i'll be

525
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:58,079
starting from and i can now

526
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:03,759
fill in two more answers

527
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:17,839
for my answer sheet 9.9.9.1

528
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:17,839
and 9.9.9.144.

529
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,080
cool so we've solved these three

530
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,879
networks so far

531
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,359
and these two networks so far we have

532
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,880
one

533
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:33,199
left and that guy is a slash 29

534
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,600
which gives us an increment of eight

535
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,279
so let's go ahead and clean up our

536
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,319
topology a little bit

537
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,480
and do the last guy in our list what

538
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,119
color haven't i used

539
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,440
this guy we're on that guy we're going

540
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,038
to start from over here

541
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,320
the increment of 8 would mean that the

542
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:54,158
next network would be 168.

543
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,359
and if there were more networks to solve

544
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,679
for in this topology

545
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,038
that's where i'd be starting from but

546
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,840
for now since the last

547
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,440
this is the last one on our list we can

548
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,798
fill that guy in as the answer for

549
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,558
our slash 29 so that right there is

550
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,918
essentially how you would solve for the

551
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,000
next network without

552
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,840
sorry how would you solve vsm problems

553
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
without having to create that huge chart

554
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,959
that we did

555
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,720
in the illustration videos all you

556
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,000
really need is the cheat sheet and

557
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,798
solving for the next network

558
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,400
sequentially

559
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:27,599
from biggest to smallest now

560
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,759
we could continue from here notice

561
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,279
we have two point-to-point links those

562
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,000
two point-to-point links need

563
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,599
two ip addresses presumably one of them

564
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,359
is for the ip address on r1

565
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,719
rather on this link one of them is for

566
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,319
the ip address on r1 and the other one

567
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,919
is for this ip address on r2

568
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,599
and then for this link it's again the ip

569
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,960
address on our one and the fp address on

570
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,959
our on our three rather

571
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
so again we can continue the same

572
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,038
pattern

573
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,480
we've been using now

574
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,038
depending on what school of thought

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,038
you're using

576
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,159
if you're taking a kind of beginner

577
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,640
level or ccna level

578
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,799
certification they will say that the

579
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,120
smallest size network you can assign on

580
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,759
a

581
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,439
to point link is a slash 30 that gives

582
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,200
you a total of 4 ip addresses

583
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,038
and if you do minus 2 that gives you 2

584
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,640
usable ip addresses

585
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:22,158
alternatively there is an rfc however

586
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,919
that does authorize the use of slash 31s

587
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,480
pardon me that has authorized use of

588
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,038
slash 31s for point-to-point networks

589
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,679
and so if you're using that school of

590
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:30,879
thought

591
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,120
then the increment you're going to be

592
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,120
using is 2 or if you're doing the

593
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,319
slightly more legacy school of thought

594
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,359
the increment you'll be using will be

595
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,480
four

596
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,639
one way or another your final two

597
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,200
networks are going to be either

598
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:50,559
dot 168 again starting from here

599
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,240
or dot one two seventy two

600
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:53,759
if your school of thought is the slash

601
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,200
thirty if you're doing slash thirties

602
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,798
for those point two points

603
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,038
or if you're doing slash thirty ones for

604
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,720
those point two points

605
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,519
your network id for both of those is

606
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,679
going to be 168 and 170.

607
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,720
again just simply following the

608
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,159
increment of

609
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
two or four depending on what size

610
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,640
you're using

611
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,319
yeah great china asks a great question

612
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,319
is if we have to add

613
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,960
more ip addresses later it's actually

614
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,319
not a super trivial thing to do

615
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,840
that's why you want to account for

616
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,200
growth when you're signing out ip

617
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:31,278
addresses if you're designing

618
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,759
a vlsm scheme in a topology

619
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,960
but if you had to add say more ip

620
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,879
addresses over here

621
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,880
to this guy over here you would have to

622
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,520
change this slash 26 into something

623
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,120
bigger

624
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,158
potentially a 25 but in this particular

625
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,000
instance

626
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,320
you've used the ip addresses that would

627
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,159
exist in the first slash 25

628
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,079
so you'd have to kind of play some fun

629
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
games with ipaddress carving

630
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,199
or potentially use a different ip block

631
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,038
entirely

632
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,038
so not trivial but doable

633
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,479
that's one of the benefits of ipv6 in

634
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,960
fact that the every single network is

635
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,440
going to be so big you'll never

636
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,278
you'll never have to later expand uh an

637
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,120
ipv6 subnet because there's

638
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:15,839
what is it like 18 quintillion addresses

639
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,839
in every single ipv6 network

640
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,399
cool so that is the strategy for doing

641
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,678
vlsm

642
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,960
uh using just scratch paper

643
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,960
so let me check in with you all again in

644
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,840
the chat room let me know

645
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,278
how this worked out if if this all sat

646
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,918
well if you understand how i got to

647
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:33,919
these values

648
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:43,839
i don't know say again say something in

649
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:43,840
the chat room

650
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,079
thank you musa

651
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,079
thank you cal it's gonna be a

652
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,159
competition for who can take my words

653
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,319
more literal than the last person i like

654
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,320
it

655
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,679
uh absolutely yeah we're going to do one

656
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,798
more and we're going to do it even less

657
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,798
graphical than this one

658
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,400
uh okay so it doesn't look like any

659
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:29,359
questions have popped up so let's go

660
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,159
ahead and do

661
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,158
one more

662
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,880
so here's another whiteboard with just a

663
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,959
cheat sheet

664
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,159
and again in in the subdating mastery

665
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,919
video series i show you how to draw this

666
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,159
cheat sheet out super quick so

667
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,120
having just a whiteboard and this cheat

668
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,880
sheet is probably going to be a good

669
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,918
starting point for a lot of your exam

670
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,880
based subject questions so we're going

671
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,278
to go ahead and do it again

672
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,320
but let's actually have you guys tell us

673
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,400
the size of

674
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,839
rather the number of ip addresses in

675
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,679
each network we need

676
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,079
so go and throw some random numbers into

677
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:08,000
the chat room uh anywhere between 1

678
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,599
and 100 we'll say let's get five to six

679
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:21,839
of them from which you guys pick

680
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:21,839
and then we'll go from there

681
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:35,840
i'll start typing this out

682
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,200
maya suggests 78 let's go with that

683
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:49,839
again there's no wrong answer just throw

684
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,840
a random number into the chat room

685
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,480
somehow i knew that one would come up

686
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,839
cal

687
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,839
150 might be too big for our example so

688
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,839
we're just going to go with 50.

689
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,919
hi black ice bass it's just the one

690
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,798
that's on my laptop i have a asus laptop

691
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,799
hi synth welcome

692
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,720
cool so that should be enough let's make

693
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,159
sure

694
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,159
let me do some quick mental math

695
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,158
uh let's do one more

696
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:45,839
and we're going to make this guy

697
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:52,000
actually now i think i think that's fine

698
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,599
i'll just do this guy

699
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,200
okay so again

700
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,278
when you're doing subjecting questions

701
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,319
often you're going to get a random set

702
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,558
of

703
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,558
um

704
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,159
a random topology or random text that's

705
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,798
going to say something like

706
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,440
hey here a bunch of networks we need you

707
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,000
to give us

708
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,840
ip address blocks to use force you know

709
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,240
network a needs 78 hosts

710
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,839
network b needs 69 hosts network c needs

711
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,640
35 host

712
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,000
network d needs 50 hosts and so on we

713
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,520
could literally continue for

714
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,759
whatever the requirements are but one

715
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,398
way or another the process that we're

716
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,359
going to follow

717
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:31,359
is going to be the same

718
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:38,639
why is there that blue bar okay cool

719
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,640
so let's simply start from the same

720
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,919
starting point just as before we're

721
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,278
again going to start

722
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,799
at 9.9.9.0

723
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,319
but again the starting point is largely

724
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:49,679
arbitrary we could

725
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,798
we could pick any other number that the

726
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,519
problem would give us we're just going

727
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,480
to go with

728
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,679
999.0 for simplicity and just like

729
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,278
before

730
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,440
we're again going to use this cheat

731
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,398
sheet to figure out the size of network

732
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,399
we're going to need

733
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,479
for each of the networks in our we'll

734
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,918
call it homework assignment or vlsm

735
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,960
problem

736
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,759
so let me

737
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
do that and we'll start top to bottom so

738
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,558
for network a

739
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,240
i need 78 ip addresses 64

740
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,879
26 is not going to be big enough so i

741
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,278
have to go over here to a slash 25

742
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,000
so that's going to be a slash 25 for

743
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:26,319
network b

744
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,519
again 69 such 26 is not going to be big

745
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,519
enough so that's going to have to be

746
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:34,558
also a slash 25. for 35

747
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,918
i would have to get a slash 26

748
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:41,278
450 again it'd be a slash 26.

749
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,919
for 17 i would have to do a slash

750
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,200
did really go top to bottom yeah we did

751
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,399
didn't we

752
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,159
yeah two 27s so that kind of works out

753
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,158
it just slowly got smaller as we went

754
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,960
yeah i'm good with that let's do it

755
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,240
cool so right off the bat

756
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,599
and again we're going to go from biggest

757
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,558
to smallest which means we're solving

758
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,278
for network a and b

759
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,558
first right off the bat i know that one

760
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,240
of them

761
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,000
the network is id is going to be the

762
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,319
starting point so since we have a

763
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,159
starting point of 999.00

764
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,599
we know for a fact that the first slash

765
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,880
25 the biggest network we're going to

766
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,879
sign is going to start there as well

767
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:30,959
but we need 2 25s for our problem

768
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,879
so again oops so again 25 is right there

769
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,000
the increment is 128

770
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,000
so let me actually go

771
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,679
so this is going to be our first network

772
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,278
id this is going to be our next network

773
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,880
id for a slash 25

774
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,000
but again you have to go one more so you

775
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,720
know what the next network is going to

776
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,038
be

777
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,278
and now the next network for this guy is

778
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,158
going to end in dot zero in the fourth

779
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,000
octet

780
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,440
but since we had to reset the fourth

781
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
octet 2.0

782
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,720
we actually have to increase the third

783
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,000
octet so if you

784
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,120
bring down all these values

785
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,599
you'll actually see what i mean by that

786
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,639
this third value that i've listed is the

787
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,678
next network

788
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,840
after 9.9.9.128

789
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,159
i should say the third 25 network after

790
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,000
9.99.128

791
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,799
it goes to 9.9.10.0

792
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,759
now again we picked that pos process and

793
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:29,519
why that happens

794
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,359
apart in the submitting mastery video

795
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,960
series so if that's unfamiliar to you

796
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,199
check out i believe video four is the

797
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,919
one we where we do problem examples

798
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,240
and i believe it's the last it's it's

799
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,600
the

800
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,038
example number three or number four

801
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,199
where we where we show you what's going

802
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,398
on with this

803
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,200
in any case this this gives us the

804
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,759
the answers we are looking for we know

805
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,558
that our first slash 25

806
00:32:51,759 --> 00:33:01,440
is 9.9.9.0.25 and our next slash 25

807
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:03,918
is going to be 9.9.9.9.128

808
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,919
25.

809
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:11,839
yep we'll do this for spacing purposes

810
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,839
cool

811
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,558
so next we have two 26's to solve for

812
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,278
and just like before we will look at the

813
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:22,879
cheat sheet

814
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,960
to figure out that a slash 26 has an

815
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,600
increment of 64

816
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,600
which means that the next so this is

817
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:38,719
going to be our first slash 26

818
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:40,719
the next slash 26 oops

819
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,558
the next slash 26 is going to be where

820
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,319
we started plus 64.

821
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,038
and then the one after that to solve for

822
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,038
the next network

823
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,840
is going to be 128.

824
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,839
but this does give us the two network

825
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,880
ids we need

826
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,879
for network c and network

827
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,839
d

828
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,280
which then brings us to our two 27s

829
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:28,638
and just like before a slash 27 so let

830
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,639
me clean this up a little bit

831
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:36,000
slash 27 puts us right there

832
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,800
an increment of 32 and we're going to

833
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,480
start from here

834
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,919
and go in increments of 32 so 128 plus

835
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,199
32 would give us 160

836
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,799
and again i'll bring down this third

837
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:54,398
octet that's 10.160.

838
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,399
that gives us our second network id

839
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,400
and honestly at this point since i know

840
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,000
the problem only asks us for two more

841
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,680
i would just stop right here knowing

842
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,719
that these two are the last two answers

843
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,838
we need

844
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,279
if i needed to solve for more networks i

845
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,559
would obviously need to figure out

846
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,839
the next network as well which would

847
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:17,119
bring us to

848
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:20,239
192 if i did the the math on that right

849
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:27,119
either way we have our answer

850
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:31,838
so we've got 9.9.9 rather.10.128.

851
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,838
and 9.9.10.1

852
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,159
and then right there we just solved

853
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,159
another vlsm

854
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,159
problem that we essentially put together

855
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:45,838
ourselves

856
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,800
yeah so that's the strategy that's

857
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,239
that's how you can use

858
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,079
the same cheat sheet that i showed you

859
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,000
in the subjecting mastery video series

860
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,359
to solve for any vlsm problem that you

861
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,320
have using only

862
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,519
scratch paper and pen hopefully that was

863
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,960
helpful for you

864
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,199
and kind of further landing the plane

865
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,119
with subletting i know that subnetting

866
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,598
especially at first can be a huge

867
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,079
uh burden to try and understand it's

868
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,160
kind of a strange way of doing math

869
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,920
but after a few reps and then hopefully

870
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,440
watching the the series

871
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,838
that will kind of get you through that

872
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,838
hurdle

873
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,440
okay so with that i'm going to turn it

874
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,320
to chat any questions

875
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,519
regarding what we just did or subnetting

876
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,320
in general

877
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,559
uh go and mention in chat and then we'll

878
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,920
see what we want to do we can either do

879
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:41,440
more of these or we can do a uh

880
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:55,838
submitting aggregation

881
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:55,838
walkthrough i guess we'll call it

882
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,719
i'm playing with all the different

883
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,679
options you have for where where my face

884
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,078
shows up on the

885
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,118
live stream and i've got a that's why

886
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,839
i'm looking off to the side this is

887
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,838
where my chat is it's off to my right

888
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,240
so we have one request for one more vlsm

889
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,239
prom

890
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,838
is that what people want to see

891
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:04,719
looks like yes so let's go ahead and do

892
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,838
one final problem now just for speed

893
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,838
sake i'll go and use this script oops

894
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:20,239
and we will okay

895
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,480
we so we definitely can go bigger musa

896
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,800
i'll say in in cisco exams you you

897
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,000
probably won't do too many vlsm problems

898
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,839
that require

899
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,119
you know tens of thousands of addresses

900
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,838
in a single

901
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,519
in a single subnet uh if you're just

902
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,719
talking about how to how to subnet

903
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,920
a slash 16 or slash 15 or slash 22 or

904
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,759
something like that

905
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,280
the video series teaches all those in

906
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,599
videos six and seven

907
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,640
so i would definitely recommend checking

908
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,119
that out

909
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,118
and again subnet ipv4.com

910
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:03,519
for our purposes we will stick with

911
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:15,838
tell you what we'll pick random numbers

912
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:15,838
from both of these

913
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,119
okay let's see i'm just going to retype

914
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,119
this

915
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,960
so we're going to go a needs 12 ip

916
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,319
addresses

917
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:35,358
b needs four ip addresses c needs

918
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,359
17 ip addresses d needs 43

919
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,079
e needs 32

920
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:45,920
f needs not 12 again 29

921
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,560
mcdfg and network g needs what number

922
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,599
haven't i used from the random for

923
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,599
19 looks like

924
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,880
yeah so our last one is going to be a

925
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,279
total of seven different networks

926
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,240
with this amount of required ip

927
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,720
addresses

928
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,000
per network and again just like before

929
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,399
we're simply going to step through it

930
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,639
all

931
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,400
using this exact same cheat sheet so

932
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:13,199
i'll erase everything we have so far

933
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,760
and we will get right to it and again we

934
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,759
will start

935
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,800
just because it's worked for us so far

936
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,839
at the 9.9.9.0

937
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,839
network i'll try and be a little bit

938
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,838
neater

939
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,880
cool so stepping through this

940
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,679
our first step is going to be assigning

941
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,680
out

942
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,440
uh what size network i'm going to need

943
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,559
to accommodate for every single one of

944
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,880
these networks

945
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,318
now this doesn't have to necessarily go

946
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,519
biggest to smallest it doesn't really

947
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:44,960
matter because the

948
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,400
order doesn't actually affect anything

949
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,720
when you're just assigning out network

950
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,720
sizes

951
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,679
so we'll just go top to bottom for

952
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,239
12 ip addresses a slash 28 would be

953
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,519
enough

954
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:02,639
so would go slash 28

955
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:06,880
for four ip addresses a slash 29

956
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:10,000
would do it so slash 29 oops

957
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,519
slash 29 for 17 ip addresses

958
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,760
that's not enough we would need a slash

959
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,358
27.

960
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,560
for 43 ip addresses a uh

961
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:24,000
26 would work 26

962
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,679
for 32 we would also need slash 26

963
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
and again all i'm doing is looking at

964
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:28,960
this top column to see

965
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,639
where there's a number that's bigger

966
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,519
than what i need and then obviously

967
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,480
accounting for

968
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,199
usable ip addresses versus total ip

969
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,920
addresses

970
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,759
that's why for network e over here i

971
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,358
didn't assign a slash 27 because again a

972
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,440
slash 27 is 32

973
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:48,400
total addresses and 30 usable addresses

974
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,639
but 29 ip addresses can absolutely work

975
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,400
for a slash

976
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:57,199
slash 27 rather i almost said 37

977
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,039
and then for network g 19 ip addresses

978
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,039
would also be a slash 27.

979
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,960
yeah that'll work trying to think if

980
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,838
there's anything else we want to do with

981
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,039
it

982
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,480
yep we're good with it okay so that's

983
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,679
what we're trying to solve

984
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,000
see me see the whiteboard awesome

985
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,799
uh and again we will do it just like we

986
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,280
have before

987
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,280
i'll take this and go there

988
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,480
okay so our biggest one is going to be

989
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,559
what these slash 26s right here

990
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,639
and i need two of them and if you look

991
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,759
at our table slash 26 increment of 64.

992
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,598
this right there is going to be our

993
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,800
first one our next one is going to be on

994
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,000
dot 64

995
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,839
and then we're going to solve for one

996
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
more so we have our next network for

997
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:48,318
where we're going to start next

998
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,199
so our answers right away we know for

999
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:53,599
these two

1000
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:58,799
are going to be 9.9.9.0

1001
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:02,640
26 and 9.9.9.64

1002
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,960
26. from there the next

1003
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,759
two biggest rather the next biggest one

1004
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,159
would be

1005
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,560
nope sorry oh no the three slash 27s

1006
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,559
over here

1007
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,519
so we'll pick a different marker the

1008
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,440
slash 27 has an increment of 32

1009
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,280
and i need three of them so there's my

1010
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,079
first

1011
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,079
there's my second

1012
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,078
there's my third and then again i need

1013
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,358
to solve for the next network so i would

1014
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,200
go one more

1015
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:33,598
32 plus 198 with 2

1016
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,480
224. somebody double check the math on

1017
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:40,079
that make sure i got that right

1018
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,559
but that is my answer for the next three

1019
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,160
and again the order in which i assign

1020
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,279
these is is largely

1021
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,679
arbitrary um you know whether i gave

1022
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,839
this guy the 128 and this guy the 160 or

1023
00:43:49,679 --> 00:44:00,318
vice versa it's kind of all the same

1024
00:43:52,838 --> 00:44:00,318
60 and then 9.9.9.192

1025
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,358
then i've got a slash 28 as my next

1026
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,440
biggest

1027
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,519
another color for that a slash 28 the

1028
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,679
increment is 16.

1029
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,960
that is going to be the network id but

1030
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:21,279
the next network is going to be

1031
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:24,318
240. so we can fill in our net

1032
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,880
our slash 28 rather which is going to be

1033
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:29,920
224

1034
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,200
and now that our and that's our next

1035
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,358
network right there

1036
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,879
and now that we only have one left

1037
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,480
there's not even really a need

1038
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,000
to figure out the increment for a slash

1039
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,079
29 and so forth

1040
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,519
we know this is going to be the network

1041
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:46,640
id of our next starting point

1042
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:50,079
so i can right away fill back oops

1043
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,519
fill that guy in and we have just now

1044
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,240
completed

1045
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,239
another seven

1046
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,839
now that one right there i didn't have

1047
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:01,118
the timing exactly i didn't start a

1048
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:02,400
stopwatch or anything like that but i

1049
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,160
think it only took us

1050
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,318
two to three minutes and that was still

1051
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,838
while explaining what i was doing

1052
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:09,358
if you run through this process a few

1053
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,078
more times you can get to where you're

1054
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,480
solving

1055
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,599
even somewhat complex vlsm problems like

1056
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,039
this in still 60 seconds

1057
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,240
but that's the uh that's the method

1058
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,559
that's the method that i want to show

1059
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:20,559
you guys

1060
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,680
and that actually also wraps up

1061
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,679
everything i had in mind to do

1062
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,960
for the stream and test out the the live

1063
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,919
stream setup

1064
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,280
uh i think it went all right i'll have

1065
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,039
to figure out a better way to interact

1066
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,319
with the audience than than youtube chat

1067
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,679
it's unfortunate

1068
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,119
about that delay but i think there's

1069
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,639
some software you can get where you guys

1070
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,760
can like click along with me and stuff

1071
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,879
like that and i think that's

1072
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,560
a little bit quicker uh response time

1073
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,000
uh but before i end the stream

1074
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,400
a couple things i wanna let you guys

1075
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,639
know i'm gonna hang out in the discord

1076
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,639
for the next 30 minutes to an hour or so

1077
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,279
if anybody has any other questions

1078
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,799
about anything networking related not

1079
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,240
which is not to say i know everything

1080
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,160
network related but whatever it is that

1081
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,159
i do know i'd be happy to help and share

1082
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:19,519
uh what i can if you're studying for the

1083
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,679
ccna definitely hang out

1084
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,800
definitely hang out in uh in the discord

1085
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:23,598
and you know i'm sure good stuff will

1086
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,359
come up

1087
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,838
uh the link to the discord let me put

1088
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:29,838
that guy back up

1089
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,880
is right there

1090
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,920
oops

1091
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:43,838
there should see the link to the discord

1092
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,480
by pointing the right way nope pointing

1093
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:48,799
the wrong way right over this direction

1094
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,000
but definitely come hang out i'll answer

1095
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,440
any questions for the next

1096
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,519
30 minutes to an hour kind of as long as

1097
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,200
the questions are going uh if we need in

1098
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,000
the discord i can do a screen share and

1099
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:57,439
we can whiteboard some

1100
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,719
stuff or show you guys different stuff

1101
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:05,440
if uh if necessary

1102
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:07,199
um and then the last the second thing

1103
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,559
if you guys have been following with my

1104
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,399
blog or anything like that

1105
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,838
you guys will know that i just finished

1106
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,200
recording a

1107
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:16,799
course on tls and ssl uh it

1108
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,799
took me about six months to create this

1109
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,160
course but it's a it's a really high

1110
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,280
quality course and we go

1111
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,318
in super depth on those protocols so if

1112
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,760
you're interested

1113
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,318
interested in network security

1114
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,599
cryptography or ssl and tls which are

1115
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:31,119
the you know the protocols that make the

1116
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,359
internet safe you could say

1117
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,079
uh definitely check out that course i

1118
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,400
believe i left my early reviewer

1119
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,839
access link up so feel free to check it

1120
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,358
out and take advantage of that there's a

1121
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,000
there's a

1122
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,119
pretty hefty discount for that i had up

1123
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,480
for students who are going to join

1124
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,240
before the course completed

1125
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,760
the course is complete but i still have

1126
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:51,439
that discount code up i haven't taken it

1127
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,520
down yet so feel free to take

1128
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,800
advantage of that at my website

1129
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,800
pracnet.net or practicalnetworking.net

1130
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,880
but i think that's it that's all i had

1131
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,160
let me do a quick scan of the chat make

1132
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,160
sure there's no other questions

1133
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,960
noted about twitch thanks i will look

1134
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,960
into that

1135
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,838
the uh tls content is well beyond ccna

1136
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:17,679
uh some of that stuff is a little bit

1137
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,679
ccna related but but it's probably much

1138
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:22,239
much deeper than ccna this would be more

1139
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,919
more engineering level uh and mastery

1140
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,759
level for sl and tls

1141
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,039
jeremy in fact is actually in the course

1142
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,800
and so you can take his word for it

1143
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,960
thanks jared jeremy i'm glad you're

1144
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,000
you're enjoying it uh jeremy's actually

1145
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,358
one of my

1146
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,679
one of the testimonials i've got my

1147
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,519
course signup page as it were

1148
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,598
by the way if you guys haven't come

1149
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:43,838
across jeremy's content before

1150
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:46,800
he has a free video training that covers

1151
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,199
90 of the ccna curriculum and i think

1152
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,640
he's

1153
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,399
planning to finish that jeremy if you

1154
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,519
want to if you want to fill in with the

1155
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,960
chat i think you're finishing that in

1156
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,838
the next month or so right

1157
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,838
so it's about uh

1158
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,118
so it's about about done but definitely

1159
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:05,519
check out his ccna course it's uh

1160
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,200
it's almost frustrating because i i wish

1161
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,480
i had resources like that when i first

1162
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,239
took my ccna

1163
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,920
what like 12 years ago or 15 years ago

1164
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,239
or whatever that was but

1165
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,280
uh definitely check out okay a couple

1166
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,039
months jeremy says

1167
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,359
cool oh no the discord link

1168
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,039
has expired well hang out i will find a

1169
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,598
new link for you in the chat

1170
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,599
i might yeah let me see if i can do that

1171
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,599
real quick

1172
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,519
actually i can't without disabling the

1173
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,640
video

1174
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:34,000
i'm going to hang out in the chat for a

1175
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,239
few minutes to give you guys the discord

1176
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,239
link

1177
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,240
and i guess that's it that kind of wraps

1178
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,519
up

1179
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:45,039
wraps up our stream yeah well thank you

1180
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:46,559
guys so much for joining hope you guys

1181
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:47,440
found uh a lot of good stuff from there

1182
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,880
hopefully this was

1183
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,559
this was useful for you and will help

1184
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,200
help out with uh blsn going

1185
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,640
going forward uh again hang out for a

1186
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,039
minute i'll get you guys the new discord

1187
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:57,519
link

1188
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,880
in the uh chat in a second and i'll be

1189
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:00,719
hanging out in my discord for at least

1190
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,400
the next 30 minutes to an hour

1191
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,078
to answer questions or q a or do

1192
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,160
whatever it is you guys want

1193
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,760
otherwise thanks a bunch for joining

1194
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,838
and yeah i guess we'll catch you guys in

1195
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,839
the next video thanks guys

1196
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:26,719
you

1
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,640
okay

2
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,640
well hello everybody

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
i'm excited to be doing this first live

4
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,399
stream i guess we still a few minutes

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,879
before before uh

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,558
30 after when i said we'd start but i

7
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:45,839
figured this is not a bad time to test

8
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,679
the video and audio

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,039
video looking okay give me a thumbs up

10
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,558
or something in the chat let me know if

11
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,840
you guys can see me okay

12
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,839
everything's coming through all right

13
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,358
also the plan for the day welcome if

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
you're joining us the plan for the day

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,640
is to go through a little bit of vlsm

16
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,839
training

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
hopefully most of you have seen the

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
subnet ipv4 videos or the subnetting

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
mastery video playlist

20
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,200
if you have go and let me know in the

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
chat room just so i have an idea of

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,159
where we're all starting

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,719
and what we're going to be doing today

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
in this stream is essentially continuing

25
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,798
where that live stream sorry where those

26
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,719
that video series ended

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,400
and so we'll run through a quick kind of

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,959
uh review

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,159
of what was covered in the subnet ipv4

30
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,599
videos

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,520
and then from there we'll just continue

32
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,478
dive we'll dive right into

33
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,078
some subnetting training by the way this

34
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,359
is the first live stream i've ever done

35
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,359
inevitably there'll be some sort of

36
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,959
technical uh difficulties

37
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,200
just bear with me as we kind of work

38
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,199
through it for starters every time i pop

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
out the chat in the youtube live stream

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:54,640
video

41
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:57,599
it seems to uh crash on me

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,718
so i guess we'll do it this way then hey

43
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:09,840
jeremy

44
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:09,840
good to see you glad you could join

45
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,878
okay let's get to it

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,640
so i'm going to move my face

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
off to the left over here

48
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,439
okay so if you've sat through

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
if you've sat through the subnetting

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,360
video series then you've seen

51
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,598
this slide in this slide we talked

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
through how you can take a slash 24

53
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,199
network represented by this

54
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,439
yellow box right there and break it up

55
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,119
into a bunch of different size networks

56
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,159
on the example right now you see a slash

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
25 couple slash 27 and a slash 26.

58
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,598
we explain in the subnetting mastery

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,640
video series that that's all subnetting

60
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,639
is it's taking

61
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,679
one network and dividing it into sub

62
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,359
networks into smaller networks

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,719
then we walk through these seven

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
attributes of subnetting

65
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,158
we explain what each one of them are and

66
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,439
showed you exactly how to solve

67
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,280
for each of those using this cheat sheet

68
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,400
now again all this was covered in the

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,560
subnetting mastery video series

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,640
so this should all be review but in that

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
series we went through these steps

72
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,158
and used this cheat sheet to be able to

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,879
extract these seven pieces of

74
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,759
information

75
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,439
from any ip address and subnet mask now

76
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
in that series i told you that

77
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,359
every subnetting question you ever

78
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,759
encounter is only going to be

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
solving for one or more of these seven

80
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,560
attributes

81
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,959
you're going to see that proven again

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,039
today as we do vlsm

83
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:47,840
in particular the next network one is

84
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,840
going to be very important

85
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,840
cool so i'm just checking on the chat

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:58,080
over here uh

87
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,400
n19ns the videos are at subnet ipv4.com

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,239
chen is complaining or mentioning that

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
the video stream is pretty low

90
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,280
how's the video seen stream quality for

91
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,079
the rest of you you guys getting a

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:15,840
a decent stream go and mention something

93
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,840
in the chat room if you could

94
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,639
thanks jeremy jen it might be something

95
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,839
local

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
cool awesome to hear yeah chan it might

97
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,799
be something local

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
in any case uh if you haven't seen those

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,840
videos

100
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,319
subnet ipv4.com is uh where they're all

101
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,918
posted

102
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,839
in those videos so again we use this

103
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,799
cheat sheet these steps to solve these

104
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,239
seven things

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,759
so after i showed you that i showed you

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
how to do it faster using these four

107
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
speed tips

108
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,400
and that's what led us into our flsm and

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,079
vlsm discussions

110
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,679
first we went through flsm which had us

111
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,639
stepping through this illustration where

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
we talked about how

113
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,720
you can take one subnet and break it up

114
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,478
into smaller subnets

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
and every time you do you double the

116
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,680
amount of networks regardless of where

117
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,479
you start so we'll play that again just

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
for kicks

119
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,240
if you start at slash zero again

120
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
doubling that going to slash ones would

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,680
go to two slash ones

122
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,959
if you start at slash tens going to

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
slash elevens would get you

124
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,120
two slash elevens or four slash twelves

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,759
and so on

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
we use that to answer these types of

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,960
questions

128
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,560
questions that essentially have you

129
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,918
break up one network into many different

130
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
networks that are all the same

131
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,279
size that's what makes this an flsm

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
question

133
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,319
fixed length subnet mask because all

134
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,879
those networks you break everything up

135
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,839
into

136
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,279
are all the same size finally in the

137
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,119
series we ran through

138
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,918
this illustration where we did a vlsm

139
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,720
problem with vlsm we had a network

140
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,399
topology

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
that had a different requirements for a

142
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,560
certain amount of ip addresses on each

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
network and then we broke up this slash

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,038
24

145
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,360
that they gave us the 999.0624 network

146
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,159
into appropriately side blocks and we

147
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,280
used this

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,680
neat visualization so we could see

149
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,000
exactly which blocks were going to which

150
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,918
uh particular networks

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,478
now the point the point of using this

152
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,959
visualization was as an illustration

153
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,199
tool

154
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,799
to show you what vlsm problems are doing

155
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,079
what you're trying to do with the vlsum

156
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,079
prom

157
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,599
i think it's a very effective way to

158
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,159
teach vlsp

159
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
but in an actual cisco exam or any other

160
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,600
network certification exam

161
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,199
you're not going to have time to draw

162
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,479
out a large chart like this

163
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,400
to do vlsm problems that's the point of

164
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,959
today's training

165
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,839
is i'm going to show you how to do these

166
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,318
types of problems

167
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,839
using only a paper and pen or a scratch

168
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
pad or whatever they give you for

169
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,918
for your exam so hopefully that brings

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,560
everybody up to speed with what we're

171
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,560
going to be doing

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,038
if uh that's all sitting well with you

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,279
guys go ahead and

174
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,318
mention something in chat give me a

175
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,839
thumbs up or

176
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,800
emoji or something like that just let me

177
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:17,839
know that you guys are still with me and

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:17,840
everything's going good

179
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:31,918
hit cool it does look like the chat

180
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
is further delayed than the actual live

181
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,799
stream looks like the live stream it's

182
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,239
only four or five seconds and the chat

183
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,919
is 15 seconds so

184
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,680
i guess that's something i'll have to

185
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,918
get used to it or figure out in the

186
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
future

187
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,038
in any case let's uh let's get right

188
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,919
into it

189
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,800
so i have a couple things already kind

190
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,799
of prepped for us

191
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,399
that's this whiteboard session right

192
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,679
here so on this whiteboard session

193
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,198
we've got the cheat sheet because we're

194
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,478
going to make use of that and again if

195
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,000
you are unfamiliar with the cheat sheet

196
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,279
you can draw it out we showed you that

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,519
in video two of the

198
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,038
of the subnetting mastery video series

199
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,560
and then we have this topology now it's

200
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,519
the same topology we were using

201
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,079
in the subnet mastery video series but

202
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
honestly

203
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,120
the topology is pretty arbitrary we're

204
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,240
going to use the topology

205
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,840
right here just because it already

206
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,038
exists but it doesn't really matter what

207
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,399
it looks like

208
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,079
and you'll notice this and you'll see

209
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,799
this rather because the next problem we

210
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,719
do together

211
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,280
is not going to have a topology at all

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,240
but this will help us kind of

213
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,799
ground ground the concepts in what we

214
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,200
already know

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,158
at least that's the plan now just to

216
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,959
prove to you

217
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:41,360
that this isn't that this isn't a

218
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,518
pre-built scenario or anything like that

219
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,639
i have put together

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,639
a little script

221
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,079
that just generates random numbers right

222
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,439
uh i don't know what numbers are going

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
to be are going to come up from this

224
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
right and i can show you guys the code

225
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
for the script it's just a little bash

226
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,959
script nothing nothing too special

227
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,959
get rid of this guy

228
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,799
but the point is i have no idea what

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,160
this is going to be doing or what this

230
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,599
is going to generate and we're going to

231
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,399
solve we're going to use these random

232
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,800
numbers

233
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,000
in fact in a random order we're going to

234
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,199
use these random numbers

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,839
to solve a new blsm problem that you or

236
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,040
i or no one else has ever seen before

237
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,080
and i'm going to do this to kind of show

238
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,519
you the steps required to solve the lsm

239
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,399
quickly and easy

240
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,639
so this looks like a let's do another

241
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,639
one

242
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
sorry look perfect this looks like a

243
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,958
good place to start so we're going to

244
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,239
solve

245
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:41,119
vlsm for these six networks

246
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,159
as the six networks that belong on this

247
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,278
or rather

248
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,799
not networks as the six number of

249
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,200
required ip addresses we're going to

250
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,159
need in each one of these

251
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
subnetworks meaning this network right

252
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,000
here

253
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,079
is going to need four ip addresses

254
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,759
the next one down is going to need 15 ip

255
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,879
address the next one is going to need

256
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:06,399
25 the next one is going to need 11

257
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,799
and then 62 and then 14.

258
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,039
and again i'm just i'm just put picking

259
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,799
them from what we have over here

260
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,078
and these are all randomly generated so

261
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,359
again i've never seen this before this

262
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,879
isn't something i've pre-scripted or

263
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,879
whatever the case

264
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,200
we are still going to be using the

265
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:23,679
9.9.9.0

266
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
24 network but again that the ip address

267
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,078
you start with is

268
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,078
largely arbitrary you'll see that the

269
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,120
rules we discuss sort of

270
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:34,559
apply regardless of what you start with

271
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,159
okay so with that said in the videos

272
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,599
i told you guys the first step you

273
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,399
should do when you're doing vlsm

274
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,480
problems

275
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,679
is to figure out the appropriate size

276
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,639
network you need

277
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,000
for every uh every network size that

278
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,639
you've been given

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,759
so for us we were given six different

280
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,278
network sizes

281
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,200
and what we're going to start by doing

282
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,600
is figuring out what size network we

283
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,240
need

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
for each of those networks so if you

285
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
watch the vlsm

286
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,879
sorry if you watch the subjecting

287
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
mastery video series you know that this

288
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,519
chart

289
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,880
has three lines and the first line is

290
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,078
essentially going to tell you the number

291
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,799
of ip addresses

292
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,559
in each size network and so we can use

293
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,838
that to quickly determine

294
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,838
what size we need to assign to each of

295
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
those

296
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,679
we'll do that in pink so for this

297
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:25,200
network right here i need four i p

298
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,799
addresses now it might be tempting to be

299
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
like okay cool there's a four right

300
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,599
there

301
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,399
a slash thirty is four i p addresses but

302
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,399
remember

303
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,240
this first column first row rather is

304
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,200
showing you four

305
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,759
usable sorry four total ip addresses not

306
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,160
four

307
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,958
usable ip addresses to get the usable ip

308
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,958
addresses you have to

309
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,159
you have to subtract by two so while

310
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,559
this has given us four

311
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,958
total ip addresses it's only two usable

312
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,239
addresses so a slash 30 will not work

313
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,958
for that network right there instead

314
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,440
we'll use a slash 29 which gives us a

315
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,278
total of eight addresses or

316
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,360
six usable addresses which is going to

317
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,679
be enough

318
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
for this first network and then what we

319
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,239
just did we'll just do

320
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:11,359
again for all the other networks in uh

321
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,560
in our vlsm problem

322
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
so over here for 15 again it's tempting

323
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,078
to just

324
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,278
look at that 16 to determine that oh

325
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:20,879
that's that's going to be big enough but

326
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,240
again we have to account for the minus 2

327
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,679
and the usable addresses

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,839
so for that guy we're actually going to

329
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,838
need to assign a slash 27.

330
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,720
for this guy we need 25 ip addresses

331
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,880
32 gives us 30 usable ip addresses so we

332
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,879
can still use a slash 27 for that guy

333
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,278
and then derek to answer your question

334
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,760
yes this is going to be recorded i'll be

335
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,919
posting this to my discord server

336
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,879
sometime the next day or two if you want

337
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:58,078
to see what you missed

338
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:01,200
cool so for that guy we need 11

339
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,199
clean this up a little bit

340
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,240
that would be enough for 11 giving us a

341
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,720
slash 28 for that network

342
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,639
for 62 a slash 26 gives us 64. total ip

343
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,959
addresses are 62 usable so it is

344
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,480
just barely enough we'll make that a

345
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,958
slash 96

346
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,200
and then for 14 down there this guy will

347
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,479
again be enough

348
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,160
so that will be a slash 28. so that

349
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,759
takes care of kind of the first step of

350
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,559
any vlsm problems

351
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,000
essentially assigning out what size

352
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,359
network you're going to need

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,278
for every single network in your

354
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,800
topology based upon

355
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,720
the requirements provided by the

356
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,879
question in so far as how many ip

357
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,759
addresses you need on each network

358
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,439
which for us we just picked out randomly

359
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,278
now so far

360
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,880
let me check in with you all in the chat

361
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,159
if every is everything sitting well with

362
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,039
you guys so far

363
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:56,399
if so say something in the chat or a

364
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,399
thumbs up or an emoji or

365
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
whatever

366
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,919
cool

367
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
cool cool cool

368
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,159
thanks daryl for uh the literal

369
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,040
interpretation i like it

370
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,198
okay now as you guys can see my

371
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,719
handwriting on the screen is not amazing

372
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,799
so what i'm gonna do is use this notepad

373
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,600
box over here to to give our final

374
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,240
answers

375
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,720
and what we've do so far is that this

376
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,879
first network is going to be a slash 29

377
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
this network this rather i guess the

378
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,439
second one down from the top is gonna be

379
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,320
a slash 27

380
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
this third one is going to be a slash 27

381
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,240
also

382
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,240
this guy let's go one here

383
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,879
that guy is going to be a slash 28 that

384
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,919
guy's going to be a slash 26

385
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,759
and this guy is going to be a slash 28.

386
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,078
so all we've done is we've taken what we

387
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,439
did before and then we've just kind of

388
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,679
wrote them down as our little answer

389
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,399
sheet notepad so it's a little bit more

390
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,399
uh legible

391
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,959
cool so now the second part of vlsm

392
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,440
questions

393
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,479
is actually assigning out ip address

394
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,560
blocks

395
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,360
to accommodate for the size of networks

396
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,278
that we need based on what we just did

397
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,519
and this is the part where we go back to

398
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,399
the seven attributes of subnetting

399
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,440
in particular using the next network

400
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,720
field

401
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,600
so let's do this so we'll start over

402
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,639
here

403
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,959
we were given the 9.9.9.0

404
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:42,959
24 network so i'm going to write that

405
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:46,319
right here at the top

406
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:49,838
i know the first network i assign

407
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,519
is going to start with 9.9.9.0

408
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,040
i just need to figure out the proper

409
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,078
increments to account for

410
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,439
all the other networks on this list now

411
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:02,000
the way to solve these

412
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,560
is by starting from largest to smallest

413
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,320
so here the largest network in our

414
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,799
topology is going to be this guy right

415
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,720
here

416
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:12,559
our slash 26 well if we look at our

417
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,800
submitting cheat sheet we know that a

418
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,518
slash 26 has a next

419
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,198
rather has an increment of 64. which

420
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,560
means if i was trying to break up

421
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:26,319
my 9.9.9.0 24 network into

422
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,518
26's i would go in sets of 64.

423
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,839
so the first jump would take me to 64.

424
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,799
the next jump would take me to 128 and

425
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:40,160
the next one would take me to 160

426
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:43,039
wow math fail 162. that's not right at

427
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,039
all 192.

428
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,120
now that would work that would work

429
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,959
if we were trying to break it up into

430
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,560
you know just sets of four

431
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,638
slash 26s but we only need one slash 26

432
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,479
to account for this problem

433
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,558
so really i didn't need to go this far

434
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,199
this is going to be the slash 26 network

435
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,480
that i'm going to assign

436
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,919
to that network so it's going to be this

437
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,199
guy right here 9.9.9.0

438
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,038
26. but if you recall from the

439
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,640
subnetting

440
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:23,119
mastery videos the increment

441
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,520
after your starting point is the next

442
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,519
network

443
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,519
so this right here is the netid that i'm

444
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,399
using and then the next value

445
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,879
dot 64 is the next network what that

446
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,440
means

447
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,320
is the next size network if it's slap if

448
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,200
it's a slash

449
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,599
26 or smaller is going to start on dot

450
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
six

451
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,119
on dot 64. so i can use that as my

452
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
starting point for what's next

453
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,558
so let's do that in a different color

454
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,558
oops that's not the eraser

455
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,000
so after

456
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:01,678
after my slash 26 the next size

457
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,160
network insofar as biggest to smallest

458
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,640
would be

459
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,200
the two slash 27s right here it's

460
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,759
convenient

461
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
right next to each other if we look at

462
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,599
our chart

463
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,798
a slash 27 has an increment of 32 which

464
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,159
means i can start

465
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:20,240
from this guy right here in sets of 32.

466
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:24,798
so dot 64 then dot 96

467
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,000
2. 128

468
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,839
if i did the math right these two

469
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,839
net ids that i have the arrow pointing

470
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:35,038
to are the net ids

471
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:38,720
for these two slash 27s

472
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,079
and this guy 128 is the next network

473
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
that i'll be starting from

474
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,599
going forward so we can fill in our

475
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,600
answer sheet over here

476
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:53,759
9.9.9.64

477
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,319
and 9.9.9.96

478
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,558
and where we start next is going to be

479
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,319
on the 128.

480
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,399
so let me check in with you all make

481
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,319
sure everything is tracking so well

482
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,320
tracking so far go and let me know in

483
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,000
the chat if everything is going okay

484
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:25,839
and i will spend that time cleaning up

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:25,839
the picture a little bit

486
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,720
cool cool if there's any questions

487
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,319
definitely just throw them out into the

488
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,640
chat and i'll uh

489
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,079
and i'll grab them in these pulse checks

490
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,120
i think going forward if i'm going to do

491
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,119
these live streams

492
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,558
i'd love to find a quicker way to

493
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,000
interact with the audience so i might

494
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,200
have to look into that

495
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,519
but that's another story

496
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
cool so we're just going to continue

497
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,960
continue with the same pattern

498
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,279
we've left off at 128 we've taken care

499
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,919
of assigning

500
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,359
network ids for these two 27s and this

501
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,759
slash 26

502
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,519
so the next size network if you continue

503
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,640
on from biggest to smallest will be our

504
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,639
slash 28

505
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,080
and again there's two of them so that's

506
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,000
them right there

507
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,599
and if you look at our chart a slash 28

508
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,400
has an increment of 16

509
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,038
and i'm just going to continue from 128

510
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,960
in sets

511
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,960
of 16. so our first network id

512
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,000
for a slash 28 will be that guy right

513
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:35,200
there our next one is going to be

514
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:36,640
uh 1 44 if i did the math right

515
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,880
that would actually give me the network

516
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,120
id for both

517
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,080
slash 28 but again i have to solve the

518
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,158
next network

519
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,119
to know where i'm going to start going

520
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,240
forward

521
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:51,119
so i have to go one more 144

522
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,519
plus 16 would get us 160. that right

523
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,798
there

524
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,720
is the next network that i'll be

525
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:58,079
starting from and i can now

526
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:03,759
fill in two more answers

527
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:17,839
for my answer sheet 9.9.9.1

528
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:17,839
and 9.9.9.144.

529
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,080
cool so we've solved these three

530
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,879
networks so far

531
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,359
and these two networks so far we have

532
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,880
one

533
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:33,199
left and that guy is a slash 29

534
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,600
which gives us an increment of eight

535
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,279
so let's go ahead and clean up our

536
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,319
topology a little bit

537
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,480
and do the last guy in our list what

538
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,119
color haven't i used

539
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,440
this guy we're on that guy we're going

540
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,038
to start from over here

541
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,320
the increment of 8 would mean that the

542
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:54,158
next network would be 168.

543
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,359
and if there were more networks to solve

544
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,679
for in this topology

545
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,038
that's where i'd be starting from but

546
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,840
for now since the last

547
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,440
this is the last one on our list we can

548
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,798
fill that guy in as the answer for

549
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,558
our slash 29 so that right there is

550
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,918
essentially how you would solve for the

551
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,000
next network without

552
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,840
sorry how would you solve vsm problems

553
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
without having to create that huge chart

554
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,959
that we did

555
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,720
in the illustration videos all you

556
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,000
really need is the cheat sheet and

557
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,798
solving for the next network

558
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,400
sequentially

559
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:27,599
from biggest to smallest now

560
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,759
we could continue from here notice

561
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,279
we have two point-to-point links those

562
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,000
two point-to-point links need

563
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,599
two ip addresses presumably one of them

564
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,359
is for the ip address on r1

565
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,719
rather on this link one of them is for

566
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,319
the ip address on r1 and the other one

567
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,919
is for this ip address on r2

568
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,599
and then for this link it's again the ip

569
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,960
address on our one and the fp address on

570
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,959
our on our three rather

571
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
so again we can continue the same

572
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,038
pattern

573
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,480
we've been using now

574
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,038
depending on what school of thought

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,038
you're using

576
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,159
if you're taking a kind of beginner

577
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,640
level or ccna level

578
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,799
certification they will say that the

579
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,120
smallest size network you can assign on

580
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,759
a

581
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,439
to point link is a slash 30 that gives

582
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,200
you a total of 4 ip addresses

583
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,038
and if you do minus 2 that gives you 2

584
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,640
usable ip addresses

585
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:22,158
alternatively there is an rfc however

586
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,919
that does authorize the use of slash 31s

587
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,480
pardon me that has authorized use of

588
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,038
slash 31s for point-to-point networks

589
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,679
and so if you're using that school of

590
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:30,879
thought

591
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,120
then the increment you're going to be

592
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,120
using is 2 or if you're doing the

593
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,319
slightly more legacy school of thought

594
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,359
the increment you'll be using will be

595
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,480
four

596
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,639
one way or another your final two

597
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,200
networks are going to be either

598
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:50,559
dot 168 again starting from here

599
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,240
or dot one two seventy two

600
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:53,759
if your school of thought is the slash

601
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,200
thirty if you're doing slash thirties

602
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,798
for those point two points

603
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,038
or if you're doing slash thirty ones for

604
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,720
those point two points

605
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,519
your network id for both of those is

606
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,679
going to be 168 and 170.

607
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,720
again just simply following the

608
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,159
increment of

609
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
two or four depending on what size

610
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,640
you're using

611
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,319
yeah great china asks a great question

612
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,319
is if we have to add

613
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,960
more ip addresses later it's actually

614
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,319
not a super trivial thing to do

615
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,840
that's why you want to account for

616
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,200
growth when you're signing out ip

617
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:31,278
addresses if you're designing

618
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,759
a vlsm scheme in a topology

619
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,960
but if you had to add say more ip

620
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,879
addresses over here

621
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,880
to this guy over here you would have to

622
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,520
change this slash 26 into something

623
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,120
bigger

624
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,158
potentially a 25 but in this particular

625
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,000
instance

626
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,320
you've used the ip addresses that would

627
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,159
exist in the first slash 25

628
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,079
so you'd have to kind of play some fun

629
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
games with ipaddress carving

630
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,199
or potentially use a different ip block

631
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,038
entirely

632
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,038
so not trivial but doable

633
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,479
that's one of the benefits of ipv6 in

634
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,960
fact that the every single network is

635
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,440
going to be so big you'll never

636
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,278
you'll never have to later expand uh an

637
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,120
ipv6 subnet because there's

638
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:15,839
what is it like 18 quintillion addresses

639
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,839
in every single ipv6 network

640
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,399
cool so that is the strategy for doing

641
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,678
vlsm

642
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,960
uh using just scratch paper

643
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,960
so let me check in with you all again in

644
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,840
the chat room let me know

645
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,278
how this worked out if if this all sat

646
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,918
well if you understand how i got to

647
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:33,919
these values

648
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:43,839
i don't know say again say something in

649
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:43,840
the chat room

650
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,079
thank you musa

651
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,079
thank you cal it's gonna be a

652
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,159
competition for who can take my words

653
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,319
more literal than the last person i like

654
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,320
it

655
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,679
uh absolutely yeah we're going to do one

656
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,798
more and we're going to do it even less

657
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,798
graphical than this one

658
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,400
uh okay so it doesn't look like any

659
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:29,359
questions have popped up so let's go

660
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,159
ahead and do

661
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,158
one more

662
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,880
so here's another whiteboard with just a

663
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,959
cheat sheet

664
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,159
and again in in the subdating mastery

665
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,919
video series i show you how to draw this

666
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,159
cheat sheet out super quick so

667
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,120
having just a whiteboard and this cheat

668
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,880
sheet is probably going to be a good

669
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,918
starting point for a lot of your exam

670
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,880
based subject questions so we're going

671
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,278
to go ahead and do it again

672
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,320
but let's actually have you guys tell us

673
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,400
the size of

674
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,839
rather the number of ip addresses in

675
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,679
each network we need

676
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,079
so go and throw some random numbers into

677
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:08,000
the chat room uh anywhere between 1

678
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,599
and 100 we'll say let's get five to six

679
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:21,839
of them from which you guys pick

680
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:21,839
and then we'll go from there

681
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:35,840
i'll start typing this out

682
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,200
maya suggests 78 let's go with that

683
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:49,839
again there's no wrong answer just throw

684
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,840
a random number into the chat room

685
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,480
somehow i knew that one would come up

686
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,839
cal

687
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,839
150 might be too big for our example so

688
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,839
we're just going to go with 50.

689
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,919
hi black ice bass it's just the one

690
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,798
that's on my laptop i have a asus laptop

691
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,799
hi synth welcome

692
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,720
cool so that should be enough let's make

693
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,159
sure

694
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,159
let me do some quick mental math

695
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,158
uh let's do one more

696
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:45,839
and we're going to make this guy

697
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:52,000
actually now i think i think that's fine

698
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,599
i'll just do this guy

699
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,200
okay so again

700
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,278
when you're doing subjecting questions

701
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,319
often you're going to get a random set

702
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,558
of

703
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,558
um

704
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,159
a random topology or random text that's

705
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,798
going to say something like

706
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,440
hey here a bunch of networks we need you

707
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,000
to give us

708
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,840
ip address blocks to use force you know

709
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,240
network a needs 78 hosts

710
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,839
network b needs 69 hosts network c needs

711
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,640
35 host

712
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,000
network d needs 50 hosts and so on we

713
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,520
could literally continue for

714
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,759
whatever the requirements are but one

715
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,398
way or another the process that we're

716
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,359
going to follow

717
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:31,359
is going to be the same

718
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:38,639
why is there that blue bar okay cool

719
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,640
so let's simply start from the same

720
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,919
starting point just as before we're

721
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,278
again going to start

722
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,799
at 9.9.9.0

723
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,319
but again the starting point is largely

724
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:49,679
arbitrary we could

725
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,798
we could pick any other number that the

726
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,519
problem would give us we're just going

727
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,480
to go with

728
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,679
999.0 for simplicity and just like

729
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,278
before

730
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,440
we're again going to use this cheat

731
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,398
sheet to figure out the size of network

732
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,399
we're going to need

733
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,479
for each of the networks in our we'll

734
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,918
call it homework assignment or vlsm

735
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,960
problem

736
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,759
so let me

737
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
do that and we'll start top to bottom so

738
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,558
for network a

739
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,240
i need 78 ip addresses 64

740
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,879
26 is not going to be big enough so i

741
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,278
have to go over here to a slash 25

742
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,000
so that's going to be a slash 25 for

743
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:26,319
network b

744
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,519
again 69 such 26 is not going to be big

745
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,519
enough so that's going to have to be

746
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:34,558
also a slash 25. for 35

747
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,918
i would have to get a slash 26

748
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:41,278
450 again it'd be a slash 26.

749
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,919
for 17 i would have to do a slash

750
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,200
did really go top to bottom yeah we did

751
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,399
didn't we

752
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,159
yeah two 27s so that kind of works out

753
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,158
it just slowly got smaller as we went

754
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,960
yeah i'm good with that let's do it

755
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,240
cool so right off the bat

756
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,599
and again we're going to go from biggest

757
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,558
to smallest which means we're solving

758
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,278
for network a and b

759
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,558
first right off the bat i know that one

760
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,240
of them

761
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,000
the network is id is going to be the

762
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,319
starting point so since we have a

763
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,159
starting point of 999.00

764
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,599
we know for a fact that the first slash

765
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,880
25 the biggest network we're going to

766
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,879
sign is going to start there as well

767
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:30,959
but we need 2 25s for our problem

768
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,879
so again oops so again 25 is right there

769
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,000
the increment is 128

770
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,000
so let me actually go

771
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,679
so this is going to be our first network

772
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,278
id this is going to be our next network

773
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,880
id for a slash 25

774
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,000
but again you have to go one more so you

775
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,720
know what the next network is going to

776
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,038
be

777
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,278
and now the next network for this guy is

778
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,158
going to end in dot zero in the fourth

779
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,000
octet

780
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,440
but since we had to reset the fourth

781
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
octet 2.0

782
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,720
we actually have to increase the third

783
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,000
octet so if you

784
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,120
bring down all these values

785
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,599
you'll actually see what i mean by that

786
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,639
this third value that i've listed is the

787
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,678
next network

788
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,840
after 9.9.9.128

789
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,159
i should say the third 25 network after

790
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,000
9.99.128

791
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,799
it goes to 9.9.10.0

792
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,759
now again we picked that pos process and

793
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:29,519
why that happens

794
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,359
apart in the submitting mastery video

795
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,960
series so if that's unfamiliar to you

796
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,199
check out i believe video four is the

797
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,919
one we where we do problem examples

798
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,240
and i believe it's the last it's it's

799
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,600
the

800
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,038
example number three or number four

801
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,199
where we where we show you what's going

802
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,398
on with this

803
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,200
in any case this this gives us the

804
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,759
the answers we are looking for we know

805
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,558
that our first slash 25

806
00:32:51,759 --> 00:33:01,440
is 9.9.9.0.25 and our next slash 25

807
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:03,918
is going to be 9.9.9.9.128

808
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,919
25.

809
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:11,839
yep we'll do this for spacing purposes

810
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,839
cool

811
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,558
so next we have two 26's to solve for

812
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,278
and just like before we will look at the

813
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:22,879
cheat sheet

814
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,960
to figure out that a slash 26 has an

815
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,600
increment of 64

816
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,600
which means that the next so this is

817
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:38,719
going to be our first slash 26

818
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:40,719
the next slash 26 oops

819
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,558
the next slash 26 is going to be where

820
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,319
we started plus 64.

821
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,038
and then the one after that to solve for

822
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,038
the next network

823
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,840
is going to be 128.

824
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,839
but this does give us the two network

825
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,880
ids we need

826
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,879
for network c and network

827
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,839
d

828
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,280
which then brings us to our two 27s

829
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:28,638
and just like before a slash 27 so let

830
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,639
me clean this up a little bit

831
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:36,000
slash 27 puts us right there

832
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,800
an increment of 32 and we're going to

833
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,480
start from here

834
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,919
and go in increments of 32 so 128 plus

835
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,199
32 would give us 160

836
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,799
and again i'll bring down this third

837
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:54,398
octet that's 10.160.

838
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,399
that gives us our second network id

839
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,400
and honestly at this point since i know

840
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,000
the problem only asks us for two more

841
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,680
i would just stop right here knowing

842
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,719
that these two are the last two answers

843
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,838
we need

844
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,279
if i needed to solve for more networks i

845
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,559
would obviously need to figure out

846
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,839
the next network as well which would

847
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:17,119
bring us to

848
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:20,239
192 if i did the the math on that right

849
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:27,119
either way we have our answer

850
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:31,838
so we've got 9.9.9 rather.10.128.

851
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,838
and 9.9.10.1

852
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,159
and then right there we just solved

853
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,159
another vlsm

854
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,159
problem that we essentially put together

855
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:45,838
ourselves

856
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,800
yeah so that's the strategy that's

857
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,239
that's how you can use

858
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,079
the same cheat sheet that i showed you

859
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,000
in the subjecting mastery video series

860
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,359
to solve for any vlsm problem that you

861
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,320
have using only

862
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,519
scratch paper and pen hopefully that was

863
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,960
helpful for you

864
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,199
and kind of further landing the plane

865
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,119
with subletting i know that subnetting

866
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,598
especially at first can be a huge

867
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,079
uh burden to try and understand it's

868
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,160
kind of a strange way of doing math

869
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,920
but after a few reps and then hopefully

870
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,440
watching the the series

871
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,838
that will kind of get you through that

872
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,838
hurdle

873
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,440
okay so with that i'm going to turn it

874
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,320
to chat any questions

875
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,519
regarding what we just did or subnetting

876
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,320
in general

877
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,559
uh go and mention in chat and then we'll

878
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,920
see what we want to do we can either do

879
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:41,440
more of these or we can do a uh

880
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:55,838
submitting aggregation

881
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:55,838
walkthrough i guess we'll call it

882
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,719
i'm playing with all the different

883
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,679
options you have for where where my face

884
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,078
shows up on the

885
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,118
live stream and i've got a that's why

886
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,839
i'm looking off to the side this is

887
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,838
where my chat is it's off to my right

888
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,240
so we have one request for one more vlsm

889
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,239
prom

890
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,838
is that what people want to see

891
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:04,719
looks like yes so let's go ahead and do

892
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,838
one final problem now just for speed

893
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,838
sake i'll go and use this script oops

894
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:20,239
and we will okay

895
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,480
we so we definitely can go bigger musa

896
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,800
i'll say in in cisco exams you you

897
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,000
probably won't do too many vlsm problems

898
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,839
that require

899
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,119
you know tens of thousands of addresses

900
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,838
in a single

901
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,519
in a single subnet uh if you're just

902
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,719
talking about how to how to subnet

903
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,920
a slash 16 or slash 15 or slash 22 or

904
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,759
something like that

905
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,280
the video series teaches all those in

906
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,599
videos six and seven

907
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,640
so i would definitely recommend checking

908
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,119
that out

909
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,118
and again subnet ipv4.com

910
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:03,519
for our purposes we will stick with

911
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:15,838
tell you what we'll pick random numbers

912
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:15,838
from both of these

913
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,119
okay let's see i'm just going to retype

914
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,119
this

915
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,960
so we're going to go a needs 12 ip

916
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,319
addresses

917
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:35,358
b needs four ip addresses c needs

918
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,359
17 ip addresses d needs 43

919
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,079
e needs 32

920
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:45,920
f needs not 12 again 29

921
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,560
mcdfg and network g needs what number

922
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,599
haven't i used from the random for

923
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,599
19 looks like

924
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,880
yeah so our last one is going to be a

925
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,279
total of seven different networks

926
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,240
with this amount of required ip

927
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,720
addresses

928
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,000
per network and again just like before

929
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,399
we're simply going to step through it

930
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,639
all

931
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,400
using this exact same cheat sheet so

932
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:13,199
i'll erase everything we have so far

933
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,760
and we will get right to it and again we

934
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,759
will start

935
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,800
just because it's worked for us so far

936
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,839
at the 9.9.9.0

937
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,839
network i'll try and be a little bit

938
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,838
neater

939
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,880
cool so stepping through this

940
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,679
our first step is going to be assigning

941
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,680
out

942
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,440
uh what size network i'm going to need

943
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,559
to accommodate for every single one of

944
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,880
these networks

945
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,318
now this doesn't have to necessarily go

946
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,519
biggest to smallest it doesn't really

947
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:44,960
matter because the

948
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,400
order doesn't actually affect anything

949
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,720
when you're just assigning out network

950
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,720
sizes

951
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,679
so we'll just go top to bottom for

952
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,239
12 ip addresses a slash 28 would be

953
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,519
enough

954
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:02,639
so would go slash 28

955
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:06,880
for four ip addresses a slash 29

956
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:10,000
would do it so slash 29 oops

957
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,519
slash 29 for 17 ip addresses

958
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,760
that's not enough we would need a slash

959
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,358
27.

960
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,560
for 43 ip addresses a uh

961
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:24,000
26 would work 26

962
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,679
for 32 we would also need slash 26

963
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
and again all i'm doing is looking at

964
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:28,960
this top column to see

965
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,639
where there's a number that's bigger

966
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,519
than what i need and then obviously

967
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,480
accounting for

968
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,199
usable ip addresses versus total ip

969
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,920
addresses

970
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,759
that's why for network e over here i

971
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,358
didn't assign a slash 27 because again a

972
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,440
slash 27 is 32

973
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:48,400
total addresses and 30 usable addresses

974
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,639
but 29 ip addresses can absolutely work

975
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,400
for a slash

976
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:57,199
slash 27 rather i almost said 37

977
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,039
and then for network g 19 ip addresses

978
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,039
would also be a slash 27.

979
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,960
yeah that'll work trying to think if

980
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,838
there's anything else we want to do with

981
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,039
it

982
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,480
yep we're good with it okay so that's

983
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,679
what we're trying to solve

984
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,000
see me see the whiteboard awesome

985
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,799
uh and again we will do it just like we

986
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,280
have before

987
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,280
i'll take this and go there

988
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,480
okay so our biggest one is going to be

989
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,559
what these slash 26s right here

990
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,639
and i need two of them and if you look

991
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,759
at our table slash 26 increment of 64.

992
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,598
this right there is going to be our

993
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,800
first one our next one is going to be on

994
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,000
dot 64

995
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,839
and then we're going to solve for one

996
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
more so we have our next network for

997
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:48,318
where we're going to start next

998
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,199
so our answers right away we know for

999
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:53,599
these two

1000
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:58,799
are going to be 9.9.9.0

1001
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:02,640
26 and 9.9.9.64

1002
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,960
26. from there the next

1003
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,759
two biggest rather the next biggest one

1004
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,159
would be

1005
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,560
nope sorry oh no the three slash 27s

1006
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,559
over here

1007
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,519
so we'll pick a different marker the

1008
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,440
slash 27 has an increment of 32

1009
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,280
and i need three of them so there's my

1010
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,079
first

1011
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,079
there's my second

1012
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,078
there's my third and then again i need

1013
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,358
to solve for the next network so i would

1014
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,200
go one more

1015
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:33,598
32 plus 198 with 2

1016
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,480
224. somebody double check the math on

1017
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:40,079
that make sure i got that right

1018
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,559
but that is my answer for the next three

1019
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,160
and again the order in which i assign

1020
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,279
these is is largely

1021
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,679
arbitrary um you know whether i gave

1022
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,839
this guy the 128 and this guy the 160 or

1023
00:43:49,679 --> 00:44:00,318
vice versa it's kind of all the same

1024
00:43:52,838 --> 00:44:00,318
60 and then 9.9.9.192

1025
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,358
then i've got a slash 28 as my next

1026
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,440
biggest

1027
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,519
another color for that a slash 28 the

1028
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,679
increment is 16.

1029
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,960
that is going to be the network id but

1030
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:21,279
the next network is going to be

1031
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:24,318
240. so we can fill in our net

1032
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,880
our slash 28 rather which is going to be

1033
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:29,920
224

1034
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,200
and now that our and that's our next

1035
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,358
network right there

1036
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,879
and now that we only have one left

1037
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,480
there's not even really a need

1038
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,000
to figure out the increment for a slash

1039
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,079
29 and so forth

1040
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,519
we know this is going to be the network

1041
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:46,640
id of our next starting point

1042
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:50,079
so i can right away fill back oops

1043
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,519
fill that guy in and we have just now

1044
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,240
completed

1045
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,239
another seven

1046
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,839
now that one right there i didn't have

1047
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:01,118
the timing exactly i didn't start a

1048
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:02,400
stopwatch or anything like that but i

1049
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,160
think it only took us

1050
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,318
two to three minutes and that was still

1051
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,838
while explaining what i was doing

1052
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:09,358
if you run through this process a few

1053
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,078
more times you can get to where you're

1054
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,480
solving

1055
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,599
even somewhat complex vlsm problems like

1056
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,039
this in still 60 seconds

1057
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,240
but that's the uh that's the method

1058
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,559
that's the method that i want to show

1059
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:20,559
you guys

1060
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,680
and that actually also wraps up

1061
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,679
everything i had in mind to do

1062
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,960
for the stream and test out the the live

1063
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,919
stream setup

1064
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,280
uh i think it went all right i'll have

1065
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,039
to figure out a better way to interact

1066
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,319
with the audience than than youtube chat

1067
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,679
it's unfortunate

1068
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,119
about that delay but i think there's

1069
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,639
some software you can get where you guys

1070
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,760
can like click along with me and stuff

1071
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,879
like that and i think that's

1072
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,560
a little bit quicker uh response time

1073
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,000
uh but before i end the stream

1074
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,400
a couple things i wanna let you guys

1075
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,639
know i'm gonna hang out in the discord

1076

for the next 30 minutes to an hour or so

1077
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,279
if anybody has any other questions

1078
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,799

blog or anything like that

1105
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,838
you guys will know that i just finished

1106
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,200
recording a

1107
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:16,799
course on tls and ssl uh it

1108
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,799
took me about six months to create this

1109
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,160
course but it's a it's a really high

1110
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,280
quality course and we go

1111
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,318
in super depth on those protocols so if

1112
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,760
you're interested

1113
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,318
interested in network security

1114
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,599
cryptography or ssl and tls which are

1115
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:31,119
the you know the protocols that make the

1116
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,359
internet safe you could say

1117
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,079
uh definitely check out that course i

1118
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,400
believe i left my early reviewer

1119
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,839
access link up so feel free to check it

1120
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,358
out and take advantage of that there's a

1121
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,000
there's a

1122
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,119
pretty hefty discount for that i had up

1123
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,480
for students who are going to join

1124
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,240
before the course completed

1125
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,760
the course is complete but i still have

1126
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:51,439
that discount code up i haven't taken it

1127
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,520
down yet so feel free to take

1128
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,800
advantage of that at my website

1129
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,800
pracnet.net or practicalnetworking.net

1130
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,880
but i think that's it that's all i had

1131
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,160
let me do a quick scan of the chat make

1132
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,160
sure there's no other questions

1133
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,960
noted about twitch thanks i will look

1134
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,960
into that

1135
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,838
the uh tls content is well beyond ccna

1136
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:17,679
uh some of that stuff is a little bit

1137
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,679
ccna related but but it's probably much

1138
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:22,239
much deeper than ccna this would be more

1139
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,919
more engineering level uh and mastery

1140
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,759
level for sl and tls

1141
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,039
jeremy in fact is actually in the course

1142
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,800
and so you can take his word for it

1143
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,960
thanks jared jeremy i'm glad you're

1144
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,000
you're enjoying it uh jeremy's actually

1145
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,358
one of my

1146
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,679
one of the testimonials i've got my

1147
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,519
course signup page as it were

1148
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,598
by the way if you guys haven't come

1149
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:43,838
across jeremy's content before

1150
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:46,800
he has a free video training that covers

1151
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,199
90 of the ccna curriculum and i think

1152
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,640
he's

1153
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,399
planning to finish that jeremy if you

1154
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,519
want to if you want to fill in with the

1155
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,960
chat i think you're finishing that in

1156
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,838
the next month or so right

1157
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,838
so it's about uh

1158
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,118
so it's about about done but definitely

1159
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:05,519
check out his ccna course it's uh

1160
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,200
it's almost frustrating because i i wish

1161
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,480
i had resources like that when i first

1162
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,239
took my ccna

1163
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,920
what like 12 years ago or 15 years ago

1164
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,239
or whatever that was but

1165
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,280
uh definitely check out okay a couple

1166
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,039
months jeremy says

1167
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,359
